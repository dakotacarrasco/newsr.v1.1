# Creating a Topic-Based News Aggregation System from Your Local News Infrastructure

Your existing CityDigest architecture provides an excellent foundation for creating a topic-focused news platform. Rather than organizing content geographically, the system can be reconfigured to prioritize thematic categorization while leveraging your robust scraping, processing, and storage infrastructure. Consider transforming your city-based scrapers into specialized topic scrapers that target relevant sources for politics, business, lifestyle, sports, and culture. The `BaseCityScraper` class can be abstracted into a `BaseTopicScraper` that inherits the same Selenium and BeautifulSoup functionality but targets topic-specific sources regardless of geography. 

For implementation, maintain your existing Article and digest generation capabilities but modify your configuration system to define topic taxonomies rather than city metadata. Each topic would have its own set of focused keywords, source URLs, and content evaluation criteria. The scheduler could still operate on daily cycles but would generate topical digests rather than city reports. Your Supabase integration would need schema modifications to prioritize topic categorization over location metadata, though you could maintain location tagging as a secondary attribute to provide geographic context when relevant.

The digest generation process would remain largely unchanged but would be prompted to synthesize information around a thematic focus rather than geographic relevance. This transformation preserves your investment in web scraping infrastructure, content processing, and AI-powered summarization while adapting it to a topic-centric information architecture. With these adjustments, your system could deliver consistently formatted topical newsletters covering the latest developments in politics, business, lifestyle, sports, and culture, potentially reaching a broader audience than geographically-constrained digests while maintaining the technological sophistication you've already built.
