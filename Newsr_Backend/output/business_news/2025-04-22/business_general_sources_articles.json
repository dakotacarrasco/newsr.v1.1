Boat shoes are making a hipster comeback. Bejewelled Mary-Janes proliferate. But those in the know will be quietly setting alerts for Wales Bonner’s latest Adidas drop on 28 May to snag a pair of toffee suede or sequin-embellished WB Karintha sneakers.\n\nGrace Wales Bonner, the 34-year-old London-based fashion designer and curator, has been collaborating with Adidas Originals since 2020, but this is the first sneaker silhouette (slim-line, rubber-soled) that she has designed from scratch. She has a knack for starting trainer trends: in previous Adidas collections she revitalised the SL72, a crinkle-soled 1972 running shoe, and the chunky-tongued Superstar, reworking them in just-so colourways. And she is widely credited as one of the progenitors of the Samba sneaker revival, rebooting the 1950 silhouette first designed for a German football team with crochet detailing in her AW20 collection and later in glossy mock-croc leather. When Wales Bonner’s ponyskin Samba was released in November 2023, searches skyrocketed 13,227 per cent, according to data from 200 million users of the shopping platform Lyst.\n\nThe Samba is now one of Adidas’s bestselling shoes, not least because of the decision of its newish CEO Bjørn Gulden to ramp up production to millions of units when he saw things taking off in 2023. Rihanna wore them, then prime minister Rishi Sunak. The shoe helped fuel a turnaround that saw Adidas recover from a €377mn loss in the final quarter of 2023 to post an operating profit of €57mn for the final quarter of 2024. “I didn’t create the Samba, but I had a way of working with it that gave it a resonance,” says Wales Bonner.\n\n“Resonance” is an understatement: her brand is a lightning rod for modern British style whose aesthetic manages to be both refined and radical. Wales Bonner’s shy demeanour belies her brand’s emotional openness and joyful sense of freedom. When we meet in her north-east London studio – a spa-like minimalist unit in a 19th-century former millinery – she is wary, wrapping her arms around her petite frame. She wears a navy sweater, black tuxedo trousers, leopard-print Wales Bonner loafers and a smattering of jewellery. On her ring finger is an emerald ring flanked by baguette-cut diamonds; on the opposite digit is a tiny tattoo of a cross. She speaks quietly and carefully, cautious always to draw the boundaries between her professional and personal lives. “It’s kind of private,” she smiles politely, when asked where she likes to go on holiday.\n\nShe approaches fashion with an academic’s appetite for research and an anthropologist’s understanding of symbolism; Black culture is central to her work. Wales Bonner graduated from Central Saint Martins in 2014 with the dean’s commendation for a 10,000-word dissertation, “Black on Black”, that identified a turning point in the late ’60s and early ’70s where Black creatives and thinkers took ownership of their representation. Her graduate collection, titled Afrique, set the culture-saturated, formalwear-meets-sportswear template that has since characterised her namesake brand. “I want there to be an aspect of recollection in my work – a double take,” she says of the label she founded in 2014. “I don’t intend for what I do to be nostalgic; I feel like I’m more of a conduit, finding connections across time. It’s connected to how real people create style.”\n\nHer conscientious approach was born of a hard-working household. She is one of five siblings; her white British mother is a business consultant, her Black Jamaican father a lawyer. (They separated when Grace was about 10.) Her idea of style was largely informed by growing up in London. Specifically, it originated on the 201 bus. The route took her from Dulwich, where she lived, through Brixton and Tooting to Graveney secondary school where she was a student. “I saw so many people coming from different cultural backgrounds, wearing this mix of everything together. You can be wearing something traditional but with sneakers,” she says. “That duality, hybridity – it’s about being between two things. That’s the space I think is interesting. I’ve always resisted being locked in.”\n\nWales Bonner’s references are accordingly wide-ranging: she sees her research as “a spiritual and artistic practice”. Her first solo show for SS17, Ezekiel, was inspired by the court of Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie, mixing impeccably cut tailoring with cowrie-shell and bone beading. In 2016 she won the LVMH Prize, beating more than 1,000 applicants to the €300,000 award. She’s made clothes for royals (the Duchess of Sussex wore a custom dress to present her first child to the world’s media) and been namechecked by rappers (Kendrick Lamar boasted about being “best-dressed” in his song The Hillbillies: “I ain’t even gotta fact check, all I’m wearing is Wales Bonner”).\n\nHer scholarly ambitions extend well beyond the catwalk. She has curated exhibitions at London’s Serpentine Galleries in 2019 and at New York’s MoMA in 2023. She is currently leading a four-year research project at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna, which unites her long-held fascinations with music and archives. “It’s looking at how music and rhythm can be captured within other forms, whether that’s photography or poetry. And building a visual archive that explores the connection between sound and image.” It’s almost a surprise that she went into fashion at all, given her artistic and curatorial tendencies. “I wasn’t really doing it for an audience, or to set up a business,” she recalls. “It was just an evolution of my education.” In her placement year at Central Saint Martins she wangled an internship in New York with the influential Vogue fashion editor Camilla Nickerson through Tom Guinness, a London-based stylist who has styled collections for Wales Bonner ever since.\n\n“She was always thoughtful and stylish, but I don’t think she was like, ‘I’m going to be a fashion designer.’ She was like, ‘I want to communicate a vision,’” Guinness recalls of fashion-student Grace. “She was into Malick Sidibé, James Baldwin, Robert Mapplethorpe. Fashion was just the place she was at. If she had been studying painting, it would have come across in the paintings.” Nickerson, a hard person to impress, was charmed from the off. “The minute Grace walked into my apartment, I understood that she was compelling and on a mission. Whip smart in her skirt, bar jacket and slippers; so chic. She was a little intimidating. But also super-inspiring.”\n\nToday, Wales Bonner has expanded her remit from menswear to womenswear. (Women have been wearing her clothing since her debut, and she sees the collections as integrated.) “There’s a sense of formality that comes from the men’s wardrobe but I think the brand is much more expansive than that,” she says. “I like some sense of formality, but I like to disrupt that in my own way.” Its bestselling categories are knitwear and jersey, but tailoring – some of which has been made in collaboration with Savile row tailor Anderson & Sheppard since 2020 – is a growing segment. Looking ahead, she adds, “my focus is more” – she hesitates – “product-centric”.\n\nHer team numbers between 14 and 17 people at any one time; she also operates a six-month internship programme for Black students funded by the Austrian footballer David Alaba. Wholesale accounts for 60 per cent of the business, with more than 100 stockists including Dover Street Market and Net-A-Porter, though the biggest area of growth is in DTC. The brand reports that it expects to end the financial year with 81 per cent growth compared to 2023-2024, with business revenue having more than doubled over the past three years, driven by new categories such as shoes (the Jewel Mary-Jane sneaker-slipper hybrid, £560, is a hit) and jewellery (Lewis Hamilton is a fan of her brooches, £600), the growth of womenswear and “our strategic collaborations”.\n\nIt is with Adidas, however, that she has made the biggest impression. The German corporation has been collaborating with fashion designers such as Yohji Yamamoto for more than 20 years, but Wales Bonner’s contribution has bestowed on it a new veneer of cool. “It was a natural conversation because Adidas would come up in my research. The people I was inspired by would be wearing it,” she says. Her biannual Adidas collections have included a football strip for the Jamaican national team. “What I really like is that the products, they mean something. They represent something that people connect with.”\n\nTorben Schumacher, global general manager of Adidas Originals, acknowledges that the Wales Bonner link-up has enabled the sportswear giant to tap into “new consumer groups”. “We’ve been so impressed with her identity, the cultural insights that she has been bringing, her memory of our brand growing up. It has given us a new perspective on our archive that has resonated really well,” he says. As for the Samba: “Grace has been very influential and very important in the resurgence of the Samba. She has started a conversation with her audience and into fashion and luxury that we didn’t have before. It has led to a lot of hype and very fast sell-outs.”\n\nSimeon Siegel, managing director and senior analyst at BMO Capital Markets, says fashion collaborations remain key for sportswear brands who are seeking to offset their performancewear prowess with cultural relevance. “The best athletic brands in the business are both fashionable and technical,” he says. The skill lies in picking the right collaborator. “Scale is often the enemy of cool. And size can too often erode authenticity. Syncing up with a small but influential community can be the greatest validation of cultural relevance. The question becomes figuring out how to grow that halo so that it can move the revenue needle without losing what made it special in the first place.”\n\nIn June, Wales Bonner will stage a fashion show in Paris to celebrate 10 years of her business. How does she feel the narrative around Black identity has shifted in that time? “Elevating the location of Blackness within culture, that was why I wanted to start the brand,” she says. “In some ways, through many different people’s contributions, I think that that initial mission to some extent has been achieved. As the business evolves, it’s about creating beautiful and soulful clothing that is precious and timeless, and building an important institution within fashion. Showing up in different spaces from film to music to art.” In 2025, she will expand on a “musical experience” event she first held in June last year at Paris’s Fête de la Musique, with a series of listening parties. She would like to open a store.\n\n“She sees her brand not just as a fashion house but as a vessel for amplifying voices and perspectives,” says Tyler Mitchell, the American photographer and one-time Wales Bonner runway model. “Her work carries a deep, almost ancestral connection that shines through in her designs and collaborations. It’s not just about aesthetics; it’s about building a world view that’s uniquely her own.”\n\nRecommended\n\nPerhaps the most remarkable thing about Grace Wales Bonner’s expansive world view, though, is that behind it, she remains utterly discreet. Consider these hard-won facts: she lives in north London and is an Arsenal supporter. She’s currently reading Kibogo, a novel by Scholastique Mukasonga, at the suggestion of her father, and is listening to Laraaji, the enigmatic American multi-instrumentalist. She played the trumpet at school but didn’t keep it up.\n\nOne thing you might not know about her? “She’s got an enormous, quite English sense of humour and she loves comedy,” says Guinness. “Often she’ll come back from holiday and I’ll ask what she got up to, and she’ll say she watched an old funny TV programme.” Like Blackadder? “Something like that.” Then he adds: “She’s very mindful. She doesn’t just float through life. She always has this wry smile.”\n\nModels, Abdi Moalim at Squad, Abdallah El Farjani at Supa and Lebo Malope at Models1.

    "title": "I’m still in college but I’ve already started saving for retirement",
    "content": "My high school and college years have seen the Covid-19 pandemic, a rollercoaster economy, a housing crisis and soaring prices on everything from eggs to car insurance.\n\nIt made me realize that, when it comes to my finances, I needed to start thinking beyond the present, because we never know what the future will hold.\n\nMy parents instilled in me the importance of saving at a young age: When I started babysitting as a freshman in high school, they encouraged me to put aside 50% of what I made.I haven’t even started my professional working life — retirement is at least 40 years away — but with the unpredictability of the economy and the precarious future of Social Security, I’m glad I’ve taken my parents’ advice to heart.\n\nMany college students work to pay for tuition and other school costs. Others take jobs so they can pay for Beyoncé tickets or spring break in Miami.However, it’s important to start thinking long-term with your money when you’re young and lifelong financial habits are just taking shape.\n\nThat doesn’t mean you can’t go to that concert or take that trip, but don’t view them as the only target. Could you pick up a few more shifts at work or economize at home so you’d have more available for both now and the future?\n\nSome accounts utilize compound interest, which is calculated based on your principal plus your accumulated interest — it essentially pays interest on top of interest.\n\nIRAs, high-yield savings accounts and CDs all utilize compound interest, so the earlier you start investing in them, the more you can earn.\n\nAs a teen or young 20-something saving for your golden years, your time horizon is very far off. That gives you the flexibility to take on riskier investments, like allocating a higher percentage of your investments to equities. You can wait out the ups and downs of the markets a lot more easily than a 50-year-old who needs to be more conservative with their investments.\n\nAs a young person with unpredictable income, sealing thousands of dollars away for decades can seem terrifying. The money isn’t inaccessible, though you will be subject to a 10% penalty if you withdraw from a retirement fund before you turn 59 ½.\n\nAnd there are exceptions to the penalty, including if the money is used to pay for higher education. So, if your scholarship dries up or your parent loses their job, you can take from your IRA to pay for tuition with no penalty.There are other exceptions, as well, including for medical expenses, first-time homebuyers, insurance premiums, having a child and federally declared disasters.\n\nMost people think of 401(k)s as the primary retirement vehicle, but they’re sponsored by your employer. As a full-time college student, a 401(k) isn’t an option.But an IRA is. An IRA, or individual retirement account, is a tax-advantaged retirement account that anyone can open on their own. While they have a $7,000 cap, there’s no minimum deposit. That’s useful in your college years when your income can be unpredictable.\n\nWhile the IRA is in your name and opened with your Social Security number, they would technically control the assets until you’re the age of majority. That’s 18 in most states but can be 19 or even 21.\n\nI chose a Roth account over a traditional IRA because the funds are taxed now, not when you make withdrawals. Since my goal is to use this money in retirement, when I’ll (hopefully) be in a higher tax bracket, it was the obvious choice.\n\nEveryone’s circumstances are different, so it’s less about a dollar amount than a percentage of the money you’re bringing in, whether that’s $25 a month or $500. Just make sure you’re comfortable not seeing that money again until you are 59 ½.\n\nIf you invest $100 in a Roth IRA with 10% interest when you are 20 and continue to invest $50 a month at the same rate until you’re 65, you’ll have close to $438,000 by the time you are ready to retire.\n\nIf you wait just five years and start investing at 25, though, the same amount will net you a little over $270,000.That’s a difference of $168,000 for beginning just five years earlier.\n\nRoth IRA deposits need to be allocated to specific stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs or other assets. While you can do it yourself, I’m still not confident in my investing skills yet, so I chose an account that allowed me to be more hands-off.\n\nMinimum deposit and balance requirements may vary depending on the investment vehicle selected. $500 minimum deposit for investment accounts\n\nFees may vary depending on the investment vehicle selected. Zero account, transfer, trading or commission fees (fund ratios may apply). Wealthfront annual management advisory fee is 0.25% of your account balance\n\nRobo-advisor: Wealthfront Automated Investing IRA: Wealthfront Traditional, Roth, SEP and Rollover IRAs Other: Wealthfront 529 College Savings\n\nStocks, bonds, ETFs and cash. Additional asset classes to your portfolio include real estate, natural resources and dividend stocks\n\nFor a more hands-on approach, Fidelity Investments allows you to choose whether to have Fidelity pick and manage your investments or do it yourself. It’s also among the firms that offer custodial IRAs for minors.\n\nMinimum deposit and balance requirements may vary depending on the investment vehicle selected. No minimum to open a Fidelity Go® account, but minimum $10 balance for robo-advisor to start investing\n\nFees may vary depending on the investment vehicle selected. Zero commission fees for stock, ETF, options trades and some mutual funds; zero transaction fees for over 3,400 mutual funds; $0.65 per options contract. Fidelity Go® has no advisory fees for balances under $25,000 (0.35% per year for balances of $25,000 and over and this includes access to unlimited 1-on-1 coaching calls from a Fidelity advisor)\n\nRobo-advisor: Fidelity Go® IRA: Traditional, Roth and Rollover IRAs Brokerage and trading: Fidelity Investments Trading Other: Fidelity Investments 529 College Savings; Fidelity HSA®\n\nThe Ally Invest Roth IRA is another great option for beginners who are looking to be more hands-on with their accounts. Ally Invest has a self-directed trading option along with a wealth of education material on investing.\n\nMinimum deposit and balance requirements may vary depending on the investment vehicle selected. No account minimum for Self-Directed Trading. $100 minimum for Robo Portfolios\n\nFees may vary depending on the investment vehicle selected. Self-Directed Trading has zero commission fees for stock, ETF, options trades; $0.50 per options contract. Robo Portfolios have zero management fees\n\nRobo-advisor: Ally Invest Robo Portfolios IRA: Ally Invest Traditional, Roth and Rollover IRAs Brokerage and trading: Ally Invest Self-Directed Trading\n\nOffers informational articles to help users improve their understanding of investment strategies and market trends\n\nHow much you should save depends on the individual, but many experts say you should have at least an amount equal to your salary at 30, three times your salary at 40, six times at 50 and eight times your salary at 60.\n\nNo, there is no minimum amount you need to contribute to an IRA. If you have a harder year, you don’t have to contribute anything. But finding a way to put something in your account will enforce good financial habits.\n\nYes. You can still contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA even if you participate in an employer-sponsored retirement plan like a 401(k).\n\nMoney matters — so make the most of it.

    "title": "‘Definitely buy right now’ if you want a new smartphone, says retail expert—before tariffs escalate",
    "content": "President Donald Trump has said his administration’s sweeping tariff policy will incentivize U.S. multinationals to bring their manufacturing operations back to the States. That includes Apple, which the President hopes can begin making iPhones in the U.S.\n\n“He believes we have the labor, we have the workforce, we have the resources to do it,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier this month.\n\nExperts say such a move is unlikely, with Needham analyst Laura Martin saying that, even if Apple wanted to move back, it would take years for the firm to move its supply chain to the U.S.\n\nAt least for the time being, the iPhone will continue to be predominantly made in China, a country which currently faces U.S. tariffs of up to 245% — the result of an escalating trade war between the two nations.\n\nFor now, the administration has exempted Chinese-made electronics, such as smartphones, from the harshest tariffs. But Trump says the relief would be temporary and that the administration planned to apply separate tariffs to the sector.\n\nAmid the hubbub, you may be wondering — should I just buy a smartphone now before a new set of tariffs kick in?\n\n“If you have the money, definitely buy right now,” says Louis Ramirez, deals editor-in-chief at tech review site Tom’s Guide. “The reason for that is because we don’t know. We don’t know what the price is going to be one month from now, two months now, even come fall. No one knows.”\n\nWhen it comes to iPhones in particular, “Apple has a system where they always announce their new iPhone in mid-September. Then the phone goes on pre-order in late September, and in early October you can buy it,” Ramirez says.\n\nThat means if there are still stiff tariffs on Chinese imports by the time Apple announces the iPhone 17 this fall, Ramirez says, the announcement could come with news that prices are headed upward. “The price of an iPhone could even double,” he says.\n\nCompetitor’s phones — such as the Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy — are also made abroad in countries such as China, Vietnam and Indonesia, and could come with price hikes should U.S. tariff policies return in full force (including a 46% tariff on Vietnamese imports) in July, Ramirez adds. Apple, Google and Samsung declined to comment for this story.\n\nIf you are looking to upgrade, doing so now will likely save you some money, Ramirez says. That’s especially true if you intend to pay the sticker price for an unlocked phone you can use at any carrier, he says. The newest iPhone and Galaxy models cost about $1,000.\n\nYou can also potentially get a phone free or deeply discounted from a wireless provider, either by switching carriers or trading in an old device. That’s likely to continue, even if prices go up, says Ramirez.\n\n“If the price on the iPhone jumps, say, $200, and you want a deal, your best bet will be to look for a carrier deal,” he says. “If you’re lucky, you may end up not paying much for your phone, depending on what model you go for.”\n\nOf course, if your current device is working just fine and you’re happy with it, there’s no pressing need to upgrade. When it comes to core functionality, there have historically been few differences from one model to the next, Ramirez says. “I’m using an iPhone 13 Pro, and it’s still running like new.”\n\nThe bottom line: If it’s time to upgrade your smartphone anyway, you’d be wise to start looking now. But don’t buy a new phone just to buy one, Ramirez says.\n\nDo you want a new career that’s higher-paying, more flexible or fulfilling? Take CNBC’s new online course How to Change Careers and Be Happier at Work.

    "title": "",
    "content": "CNBC’s Jim Cramer on Tuesday said that as stocks surged on the day, he’s looking for potential signs that the bear market rally becomes a genuine recovery in stock prices.\n\nWith the major indices each closing over 2.5% higher on Tuesday, Cramer said he heard plenty of skepticism that the markets would continue soaring rather than reverting back to sell-off mode in the coming days.\n\nWhile he acknowledged the possibility of a resumption in stock declines, he said recoveries always start as bear market rallies before becoming something more. President Donald Trump’s assertion after the market close Tuesday that he won’t fire Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell is already likely to catapult stocks higher on Wednesday, Cramer said.\n\n“When you get this kind of rally, it doesn’t happen because someone gave you the green light to start buying,” Cramer said. “By the time there’s definitive proof, usually the rally’s been going on for a while.”\n\nWith that in mind, Cramer listed several potential indicators that the market recovery will sustain itself.\n\nFirst, he said, there’s been much discussion about how the Dow Jones Industrial Average is headed for its worst April since 1932, one of the early years of the Great Depression. That rhetoric misses the fact that the Dow bottomed out that year before recovering through the rest of the decade, Cramer said.\n\nCramer also said that productive trade negotiations could turn around market sentiment for good. It only takes one country catering to Trump’s tariff-related demands, such as helping move manufacturing back to the U.S., to kickstart a wave of concessions, Cramer said.\n\nA resolution with China would be especially helpful in avoiding more serious conflict, Cramer added, though he cautioned that Trump should be gracious rather than belligerent in his negotiations with President Xi Jinping.\n\nIf oil prices drop further, as they have for several months, that could also help boost U.S. stocks, Cramer said. A plummet in crude could spur the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, he said, which would satisfy Trump’s vocal demands for a rate cut and resettle the bond market.\n\nOther welcome signs for stocks would include soft economic data, which would also increase the odds of the Fed cutting rates, and more initial public offerings and mergers by corporations, Cramer said.\n\n“Sooner or later, somebody’s got to blink, all right? Doesn’t matter who. And when that happens, we’re going to be in much better shape,” Cramer said.\n\nClick here to download Jim Cramer’s Guide to Investing at no cost to help you build long-term wealth and invest smarter.\n\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer’s world?

    "title": "Best High-Yield Savings Accounts for April 2025",
    "content": "High-yield savings accounts are a good place to keep emergency money or savings for things you want to accomplish in a short timeframe.\n\nThe Federal Reserve maintained interest rates at the March Fed meeting, meaning national savings rates will likely continue to hold solid rates.\n\nAnother Fed meeting is taking place on May 6 and 7. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, there's over 70% chance the Fed will keep rates the same. Projections may change as the May Fed meeting approaches.\n\nWith all that said, high-yield savings accounts are still worth opening regardless of market conditions because they pay more than traditional savings accounts.\n\nWe report on the highest-yielding nationwide savings account rates currently available, as well as any local market leaders. We've listed the highest interest rates for savings accounts, as well as two high-yield accounts from popular national brands (Axos and Santander Bank). All of the banks and credit unions listed offer at least 4.10% APY (Annual Percentage Yield), significantly higher than the national average.\n\nEarn high-yields with a new account — from banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions that use partner banks.\n\nBusiness Insider's personal finance team reviewed 230 savings accounts and narrowed our top picks down to eight. The top options offer no monthly maintenance fees and many also have low minimum opening deposits.\n\nMany of the best banks and credit unions for high-yield savings accounts are online. Our top picks for savings accounts are federally insured by the FDIC or NCUA. Federal insurance protects up to $250,000 per depositor in the event of a bank failure.\n\nUnlike the other options on this list, the Community Financial Credit Union High Yield Savings Account is not available nationwide. It still makes our list because it offers a much higher interest rate on the first $1,000 in your account than other banks and credit unions do — it's hard to find even 7% interest savings accounts right now, and this account offers much higher interest.\n\nYou can earn up to 10.00%  APY in this account pretty easily; once you meet the minimum opening balance of $5, you'll automatically earn the high interest rate on the first $1,000 in the account. If your balance goes over $1,000, you'll only earn 0.10% APY on the extra cash.\n\nYou will need to qualify for membership with this credit union to open the account, which could be hard depending on where you live. To join Community Financial Credit Union, you'll need to live, work, attend school, or worship in Michigan. You can also join if you live in the same household as a current member or if you have an immediate family member who qualifies to join. If you own a business, you might be able to join through your company if it regularly does business in Michigan.\n\nCommunity Financial Credit Union has a B- rating from the BBB because it hasn't responded to one complaint filed against it. It does not have any recent controversies.\n\nThe Varo Savings Account is one of the last high yield savings accounts to offer up to 5% APY, but it only offers that high rate if you maintain a low balance in the account. It also comes with automatic savings tools that automatically transfer money from your paychecks and purchases to your savings account, if you choose to use them.\n\nYou'll need to meet some requirements to earn the highest APY, though. First, you'll need to get at least $1,000 in direct deposits each month and end the month with a positive balance in all of your Varo bank accounts. Then, you'll earn the high APY — but only on the first $5,000 in your account. You'll earn a much lower rate on any money over that $5,000.\n\nVaro has an A- rating from the BBB because of the large number of complaints filed against the bank. it has no recent controversies.\n\nThe Axos ONE Savings and Checking Bundle is a hybrid savings account and checking account, which means you can't open an Axos ONE savings account without an Axos ONE checking account. You could earn a high rate with the Axos ONE Savings and Checking Bundle; your savings account balance can earn up to up to 4.66% APY, while your checking account balance can earn up to 0.51% APY. The account also comes with other perks, like early direct deposit and enhanced FDIC coverage.\n\nIn order to earn a good interest rate, you'll need to receive at least $1,500 in direct deposits before the 25th of the month. You'll also need to maintain an average daily balance of $1,500. Alternatively, you could also receive at least $5,000 in qualifying deposits and maintain an average daily balance of at least $5,000 in your checking account. If you can't meet the requirements of one of those options, you'll only earn 1.00% APY on your savings balance, and you won't earn any interest at all on your checking balance.\n\nPibank Savings offers one of the highest-yield savings account rates nationally without any limits or requirements. This account pays 4.60% APY, and it has a $0 minimum opening deposit and no monthly service fees. You won't need to maintain a certain balance to earn this high rate, and you won't need to make a certain amount of direct deposits each month, making it a low-maintenance account.\n\nIf you haven't heard of Pibank before, it's an online brand of Intercredit Bank, a financial institution in Miami.\n\nWhile this account offers a competitive interest rate and has relatively flexible opening requirements, there are a couple of downsides. Pibank Savings doesn't support payments through Bill Pay or Zelle. You also may be charged fees by your external financial institution for outgoing and incoming wire transfers.\n\nThe BBB gave Intercredit Bank an A rating because of a few complaints filed against the business. Pibank hasn't received an individual rating from the BBB yet.\n\nThe Vibrant Credit Union Preferred Savings account could be a good option for you if you have a small amount of savings you'd like to earn a good rate on. The account has no monthly service fee and a $0 minimum opening deposit, making it a low-fee account. You don't need to meet any special requirements to earn the highest interest rate on the first $15,000 in the account.\n\nOnce your balance goes over $15,000, you'll be earning a significantly lower rate of 1.00% APY. If you're planning on keeping a significant amount of money in your savings account, you might prefer one of our other picks.\n\nCredit unions require membership to open bank accounts. You can join Vibrant Credit Union by becoming part of the Illinois Consumer Council. If you join it through a Vibrant Credit Union application, it will pay any associated fees for you. You can also join by living or working in certain parts of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, or Wisconsin, by being a member or employee of a select employee group or association, or by having a domestic partner or immediate family member who's already a member of the credit union.\n\nThe LendingClub LevelUp Savings Account could be a good option for people who want to be able to withdraw cash from ATMs.\n\nThe LendingClub LevelUp Savings Account comes with a minimum opening deposit of $0 and no monthly service fee, making it a good choice for people looking for a low-fee savings account. It also comes with a free ATM card, which is useful for people who don't mind using an online bank but who want to be able to withdraw cash.\n\nYou'll need to meet some requirements to get the highest interest rate, though. In order to get the full 4.40% APY, you'll need to deposit at least $250 each month. If you don't, you'll earn 3.40% APY — still a good rate, but not as high as some of the other accounts on this list.\n\nThe Openbank High Yield Savings has a high savings account interest rate of 4.40% (varies depending on location) APY. It doesn't charge any monthly service fees, either. The bank is an online branch of Santander Bank, a large brick-and-mortar bank that primarily serves the East Coast.\n\nThe Openbank High Yield Savings comes with some downsides that might not make it a good choice for you. You'll only be able to bank using Openbank's mobile banking app, and you'll need a phone that has either fingerprint or face recognition technology. If you don't have a phone with those features or don't want to use those features, you'll want to go with a different bank. You might also struggle to get money in and out of the account; you won't have access to ATMs or mobile check deposit with this account, and Openbank doesn't have a checking account you can transfer your money into easily.\n\nOpenbank does not have a rating from the BBB. Its parent bank, Santander Bank, has an A- rating from the BBB because it hasn't responded to one customer complaint. Neither Openbank nor Santander Bank have recent controversies.\n\nThe CIT Bank Platinum Savings account comes with a savings account bonus, which is rare from savings accounts in general and especially rare for high-yield savings accounts. If you're looking for a high-yield savings account bonus, this could be a good choice for you.\n\nCIT Bank Platinum Savings comes with an interest rate of 4.10% (with $5,000 minimum balance) APY. You'll need to have at least $5,000 in the account to earn that high rate; otherwise, you'll only earn 0.25%. The account has a $100 minimum opening deposit and $0 monthly service fees.\n\nTo earn the savings account bonus, you'll need to meet certain requirements. Earn a one-time bonus of up to $300 with use of the code PS2025 by depositing at least $50,000 of new money into the account within 30 days of opening the account or enrolling your existing account with the code. If you can't deposit $50,000, you can still earn $225 by depositing at least $25,000 within 30 days. You can only get this high-yield savings account bonus once, no matter how many CIT Bank Platinum Savings accounts you have.\n\nHigh-yield savings accounts are a type of bank account. You can distinguish them from traditional savings accounts because they pay a higher yield. That's because they're generally offered by online banks and credit unions, so these financial institutions don't generally have to pay for all of the expenses that brick-and-mortar banks and credit unions do.\n\nBesides its ability to earn more interest, a high-yield savings account is structurally similar to a traditional savings account. It still has FDIC or NCUA insurance, and you need to pay attention to minimum opening requirements, minimum balance requirements for earning interest, and common bank fees.\n\nA traditional savings account from a brick-and-mortar financial institution typically pays a low interest rate. For example, big banks like Chase and Bank of America pay less than 0.05% APY on their standard savings account.\n\nYou'll earn significantly more with a high-yield savings account. The highest savings rates land between 4% to 5% APY.\n\nLike other bank accounts, almost all high-yield savings accounts are either FDIC-insured or NCUA-insured, depending on whether you're banking with a bank or a credit union, respectively. This means your money will be ensured up to $250,000 for an individual bank account or up to $500,000 for a joint bank account.\n\nHigh-yield savings accounts can be great for when you want to earn some money on your savings without risk and while still having easy access to it. This makes it ideal for emergency funds; you don't want to risk your emergency funds on investing, and you want to be able to access your emergency funds if something major happens. With high-yield savings accounts, you'll still be able to make money off your money without sacrificing safety and access.\n\nA savings account rate is variable, which means it can fluctuate after it is opened. Your bank will usually email you to tell you the rate will go up or down soon.\n\nSavings accounts may also have transfer limits, according to federal rule Regulation D. Generally, if a savings account has a transfer limit, this means that you'll only be permitted to make six transfers from the account each month. If you exceed the transfer limit, you will have to pay a fee for each additional transfer.\n\nThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve has recently amended Regulation D, so banks may choose to suspend the monthly transfer limit so customers can make unlimited monthly transactions, or they could enforce a six-per-month limit.\n\nThere are six types of savings accounts: traditional savings accounts, high-yield savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, cash management accounts, and specialty savings accounts. The best savings account for you depends on your banking preferences, goals, and when you'll need to access your money.\n\nA high-yield savings account, for example, is a strong choice if you're comfortable with banking digitally and want to obtain a high interest rate.\n\nDepending on where you bank, some savings accounts may charge monthly bank maintenance fees. A monthly service fee is an amount you'll have to pay each month to maintain an account. Some accounts will allow you to waive a monthly service fee if you meet certain requirements, while others cannot be waived. Bear in mind that some savings accounts do not charge certain fees at all.\n\nSome banks will require you to keep some money in your savings account to get the highest savings account interest rate. Savings account promotions are also more common in a competitive interest rate environment. You might see some companies pay a bonus rate for a new account for the first couple of months. These specials are to attract new customers. To make sure you're getting a top rate, find out what the interest rate will be once the promotion is over so you know there isn't a significant decline in APY.\n\nHigh-yield savings accounts are more commonly found at online banks. You might find some brick-and-mortar financial institutions with these accounts, or a few institutions that offer a hybrid experience, but for the most part, be prepared for a primarily digital banking experience.\n\nSome banks offer 24/7 customer support by phone or through live chat, so you may look into these options if traditional banking hours don't work well with your schedule.\n\nYou can also check a bank holiday schedule to see if it has a flexible branch calendar. Some banks are open on holidays when other banks aren't, or they'll stay open for longer while other banks may close early before a holiday weekend.\n\nIf you value strong mobile banking, you might prefer a bank with one of the best mobile banking apps. It should also be noted that some smaller local institutions and new online banking divisions don't have mobile apps for their high-yield savings accounts. That could be a disadvantage because that's one less way to manage your account.\n\nA handful of high-yield savings accounts have debit cards or ATM cards, but for the most part, this isn't a common feature. Typically, you'll need to own a checking account with the same bank or make an external bank account transfer to take out cash.\n\nDepositing cash through a high-yield savings account can also involve extra steps, depending on the bank. Some banks do not let you make cash deposits on online high-yield savings accounts, so you have to deposit cash to the bank's checking account or to an external bank account from a different bank and then transfer money.\n\nA couple of online banks may have more ways for making cash deposits. For example, a few let you make cash deposits at ATMs in their network. You also might be able cash deposits at stores — usually there's a fee of around $5 per transaction, though.\n\nThe interest rate isn't the only thing that matters in a high-yield savings account. When choosing an account, make sure you can afford the minimum deposit. You should also check whether there is a monthly service fee — and if so, find out if you qualify to waive it — or any requirements to earn the highest interest rate.\n\nIt may also be helpful to look at what the requirements are for opening a savings account at a particular financial institution. Some banks allow immigrants and non-U.S. citizens to open an account with a Matricula Consular or foreign passport instead of a U.S. ID. You can also open a second chance bank account, which doesn't use ChexSystems to review your banking history. These may be options to consider if you're struggling to open a bank account at a financial institution.\n\nSome institutions also limit the number of monthly withdrawals/transfers you can make from your high-yield savings account before charging you a fee. You want an account that will result in a high interest rate and few to no fees so you can earn as much as possible. You'll also want to consider accounts tailored to your specific circumstances; for example, if you're in the military, you might want a savings account from one of the best military banks.\n\nGenerally, you'll find the best nationwide savings interest rates at online banks. That said, a local credit union currently offers the highest interest rate on a savings account overall. You may get up to 10.00%  APY on up to $1,000 in your savings if you join Community Financial Credit Union. Membership, however, is limited to people who live, work, attend school, or worship in Michigan, have an immediate family member who qualifies to join, or live in a household with a current member. You can also join through your company if it does regular business in Michigan.\n\nA good interest rate is one that pays above the average savings account interest rate. The average savings account in the United States offers 0.41% APY, but good accounts tend to pay between 3.50% to 5% APY.\n\nIf you're more comfortable banking with a brick-and-mortar bank, a traditional savings account might be a better option for you. Just know that you may not be getting the best possible interest rate because online banks and credit unions usually offer higher rates.\n\nOnce you're ready, you can apply for a high-yield savings account online. Typically, the bank will specify whether you can apply for individual and joint bank account, and if there are any age requirements to open a high-yield savings account. Some banks will only let you open a high-interest savings account if you're at least 18 years old.\n\nThe application for opening a savings account requires basic information and proof of identity like your full name, home address, and job information. Online forms also generally require your Social Security number and driver's license information, although some banks let you use an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number instead of a Social Security number. You might also need to share copies of these documents if a bank asks for it. Some permit an alternative ID if you don't have a U.S. ID, like a foreign passport or Matricula Consular.\n\nOnce you're approved to open an account, you'll be able to deposit money to a high-yield savings account. Some banks don't require an initial deposit, but if yours does, you can link an external bank account and make an ACH transfer as a funding method. If you choose an in-person bank, you might be able to deposit money at a branch as a funding method.\n\nIf you'd like to have help opening a savings account, you can generally open a savings account at an in-person bank branch if your bank has it, or you can open an account over the phone.\n\nTo maximize your earnings with a high-yield savings account, shop around to find one that pays a high rate and doesn't charge monthly service or excess withdrawal fees for taking money out regularly. You may find it helpful to set up automatic transfers from your checking account to your high-yield savings account. If you receive your paycheck as a direct deposit, you can also ask your employer to send a percentage of your paycheck to your high-yield savings account each pay period. As your balance grows with automatic savings and direct deposits, you'll earn more interest.\n\nIf you're looking for ways on how to save money and be more consistent with your habits, consider the following tips:\n\nA savings account's purpose is to give you a safe place to save money over time. If you're racking up bank fees or having a tough time managing your account, then your savings account isn't serving you. Write down the pros and cons of your current savings account, and explore other options to see if you can find a better fit.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that savings accounts aren't necessarily the best place to keep money for long-term financial goals. If you have a long-term goal and are comfortable taking on some risk, you can earn higher returns if you invest in stocks.\n\nOnce you have a savings account, don't forget that you'll need to report your interest as taxable income to the Internal Revenue Service when you're filing your tax return. You'll have to file a Form 1099-INT, which will ask you to report your interest earnings during the year.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is the central banking system of the U.S. It sets its own interest rates based on current economic conditions, taking into account things like inflation and employment. It meets several times a year, and when it meets, it announces whether it's decided to raise interest rates, lower interest rates, or keep interest rates the same.\n\nWhatever the Fed does, banks and credit unions usually follow suit. If the Fed lowers rates, you're likely to see lower savings account rates, but if it raises its rates, then you're likely to see higher savings rates too.\n\nSavings rates hit a historic high in 2023 following years of the Fed raising rates, topping out around 5.5% APY. In comparison, between 2014 and 2021, the highest the Fed ever set its rates was 2.5%. Historical savings rates follow similar patterns to historical Fed rates.\n\nThe Federal Reserve maintained rates for a good part of 2024. Savings rates started lowering in anticipation of a rate cut, but for the most part, the highest savings account rates still clung to around 5% APY. In late 2024, the Federal Reserve lowered rates for the first time after closing in on rate of inflation and unemployment targets. The Fed lowered rates three times in 2024. Savings accounts, as a result, dropped more significantly, ranging just under 4% or 5% APY.\n\nAt the first meeting of 2025, the Federal Reserve maintained interest rates. At its second meeting, which took place in March, the Fed continued to hold rates steady. While rates are still high — Fed rates are currently targeted at 4.25% to 4.50% — we're likely to continue seeing interest rate decline in the coming years. This means savings rates will continue to trend downward.\n\nInterest rates on high-interest savings accounts closely follow the federal funds rate. This means rates are variable and can change several times per year at the whim of the Federal Reserve. Keeping track of when the next Fed meeting will happen and whether rates can change can help you better understand fluctuations in high-yield savings account rates.\n\nIf the interest rate on your savings account drops significantly, you may decide to look at other financial institutions to see if you can find a more competitive interest rate elsewhere. Typically, online banks and credit unions offer the highest interest rates for savings accounts. However, bear in mind that changing accounts may not be worth the effort, particularly if your new account's rate drops afterward.\n\nYou also might consider other types of savings account options. For example, buying savings bonds or comparing CDs vs high-yield savings accounts may be worth doing if you've already established your emergency fund.\n\nThe best CD rates are comparable to the best high-yield savings account rates. You might prefer a CD if you want to lock in a high rate for a set period of time, since CDs offer fixed rates. You won't risk your rate decreasing as you would with a savings account. But CDs offer less flexibility.\n\nYou can't put more money into a CD after the initial opening deposit, and you'll pay a penalty if you take out money before the term ends. So, if you open a 3-year CD, you won't be able to take your money out of the CD until three years have passed without paying early withdrawal penalties.\n\nThat being said, something like a CD ladder, which is where you buy multiple CDs with different term lengths, could give you more liquidity while still letting you lock in good rates.\n\nIf you're trying to decide between CDs versus high-yield savings accounts, your choice could come down to when you need to deposit and/or withdraw money. (We also have a full explanation of how no-penalty CDs compare to savings accounts.)\n\nMoney market accounts are similar to high-yield savings accounts, but they typically make it easier to access your savings. The best money market accounts come with features checking accounts might have, such as an ATM card, debit card, or paper checks.\n\nThe best high-yield checking accounts are great tools for earning even more interest on your money. But checking account balances are often lower than savings account balances because you use them to spend money. If you're serious about using interest to grow your balance, a high-yield savings account is usually the better bet.\n\nThe current top high-yield savings account rate is from the Community Financial Credit Union High Yield Savings Account, which offers up to 10.00% . You'll need to live in Michigan to open an account, though.\n\nYes, the savings rate forecast for 2025 indicates rates are expected to decline throughout the year. Savings account rates peaked, and as market conditions change, it's expected that banks will steadily lower rates in response to Fed rate cuts.\n\nIt's safe to keep all of your money in a high-yield savings account if your balance is $250,000 or less (for an individual account) or $500,000 or less (in a joint account). The FDIC and NCUA insure up to $250,000 per owner, per category. So if your bank fails, all of your insured money would be safe. If you have more than the FDIC or NCUA would insure, consider opening a second account at another institution or choosing a bank that offers enhanced FDIC insurance coverage.\n\nYes, high-yield savings accounts are still great places to store your extra money or emergency funds. With high-yield savings accounts you're making money on your savings with low risk and easy access.\n\nThere aren't any nationwide banks and credit unions paying 6% APY on savings accounts right now. You can still find local financial institutions that pay at least 6% on savings accounts, though.\n\nWe consulted banking and financial planning experts to inform these picks and provide their advice on finding the best high-yield savings accounts for your needs.\n\nHere's what our expert panel had to say about high-interest savings accounts. (Some text may be lightly edited for clarity.)\n\n\"It might not be as seamless to get your money out of an online savings account as it is a brick-and-mortar, but you don't want to have so much friction where it's such a pain to get the money out when you need it.\"\n\n\"Anything with a fee is not a good high-yield savings account. Anything that restricts how much you can save is, to me, not very good. If I can't save more than $10,000 in this account, and then I have to move it over somewhere else — to me, that's not a really good savings account, because it's not really prepared to help me expand and grow, which is what a savings account is supposed to do. I also look at interest rates, definitely. I look to see when the interest is paid. Is it quarterly, or is it monthly? How often do they pay out interest, and what are the interest rate stipulations?\"\n\n\"I would consider looking for features that will help manage your account. Some banks have high-yield savings accounts that let you separate your savings into individual goals and track your progress. Other financial institutions will let you deposit cash at ATMs or some retailers. A good high-yield savings account will likely be an account where you can grow your savings without unnecessary hassles.\"\n\nHow should someone decide whether to put their money in a high-yield savings account, money market account, or CD?\n\n\"So I guess we'll start off with how much money you want to put in and the level of transactions you want to have. If you want to have any transactions, that automatically takes out CDs. Then you're stuck between the high-yield savings and the money market account.\"\n\n\"I would create a list of what I prioritize most in a bank account. For example, some banks have accounts that charge monthly service fees. I would look to see what the requirements are for waiving the monthly service fee and whether I think I could feasibly meet those requirements each month. If I'm searching for an interest-earning bank account, I'll pay attention to interest rates. I would make sure the account pays a higher interest rate than the average bank account.\"\n\nThere are many high-yield savings accounts available across financial institutions. Through our research, we've found that the best high-yield savings accounts are offered by banks with a strong online presence, robo-advisors, and other internet-only financial companies. If you're more comfortable banking with a national brick-and-mortar bank, you'll likely have to consider a premium savings account to earn a more competitive interest rate.\n\nBusiness Insider's personal finance team is editorially independent, meaning that the business team doesn't tell the team's writers and editors what to write. You can learn more about how we review products through our editorial standards page.\n\nWe have reviewed around 230 savings accounts to identify the strongest options. While interest rates (specifically, APY) are an important aspect of any savings account, we also consider minimum deposits, monthly service fees, customer support availability, mobile app ratings, ethics, security, and miscellaneous features.\n\nWe use a weighted average to get our star rating, which means we weigh certain features, like interest rates and fees, at a higher weight percentage than others. We understand that these areas can more heavily impact a person's overall banking experience.\n\nWe rate bank products on a scale from one to five stars, with one star being the lowest rating, three stars being an in-between rating, and five stars being the highest rating possible. See our bank account methodology to learn more about how we rate savings accounts.\n\n*LendingClub LevelUp Savings Account: Earn 4.40% APY when you deposit at least $250 per month, earn 3.40% standard APY if minimum isn't met.\n\n**CIT Bank Platinum Savings: Transfer a one-time deposit of $50,000+ for a Bonus of $300 or a one-time deposit of $25,000 -$49,999.99 for a Bonus of $225\n\n***Synchrony High Yield Savings Account: Annual Percentage Yield (APY) is subject to change at any time without notice.

    "content": "Auto insurance is a safeguard and can lessen the financial burden of a car accident, but only if you have the proper coverage. The best car insurance will offer solid coverage without going overboard on premium rates.\n\nAmica Mutual was ranked number one in JD Power's most recent U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study, factoring in the experiences of over 8,000 participants who had filed and settled an auto insurance claim within the previous six months.\n\nFounded in 1907 as The Automobile Mutual Insurance Company of America, Amica Auto Insurance Insurance Company is well-regarded in auto insurance. Amica Mutual was ranked number one in JD Power's most recent U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study, factoring in the experiences of over 8,000 participants who had filed and settled an auto insurance claim within the previous six months.\n\nAmica car insurance also has an A+ rating from AM Best, which looks at a company's financial stability. The more financially stable a company is, the more likely it is to be around to pay your claims when you need it. So its excellent AM Best ranking gives many consumers peace of mind.\n\nAmica offers liability, collision, comprehensive, and other common types of auto insurance. It also provides gap coverage, which can be helpful if you get into an accident with a vehicle you're currently financing. This covers any difference between your car's value and your loan balance in the event of a total loss. The exact limits and terms may vary based on the plan you buy. As such, we recommend speaking with an Amica agent to ensure you understand everything you need to know.\n\nYou can also opt for roadside assistance or get its premium option, Platinum Choice® Auto. It comes with glass repair with no deductible, rental coverage, new car replacement, and more. Amica also offers a mobile app to manage all your insurance needs.\n\nDiscounts for airbags, anti-theft system, military, good student, good driver, multi-car discounts, and bundling insurance\n\nGEICO offers auto, homeowners, and life insurance. It's been around since 1936 and generally offers some of the lowest rates. However, customer satisfaction may be an issue.\n\nIf you want competitive and affordable car insurance rates, look no further than GEICO Auto Insurance. According to the company website, you could save up to $500 by switching to GEICO. Customers can confirm the pricing in minutes with online quotes. With 85 years in the industry, GEICO offers affordable premiums and can be a good fit for those with poor credit.\n\nTo keep prices low, GEICO also offers numerous discounts to drivers, including discounts for safety devices like anti-lock brakes, seat belt use, defensive driving courses, and being a good student. We also included GEICO in our guide to the best car insurance companies for seniors thanks to its notable discounts for older drivers. In addition, policies can be managed online or via GEICO's app with 24/7 access to all policy documents.\n\nThe reviews we saw indicated GEICO's claims team was similarly quick, with a few mentions of adjusters who took additional steps to minimize or eliminate policyholders' out-of-pocket costs in a claim. From what we've gathered, rate hikes after an accident seem small compared to many other discount car insurance companies.\n\nUSAA Auto Insurance could be a great option if you're a current or former military member; no one else is eligible. Coverage is available in all 50 states, and premiums are generally affordable.\n\nUSAA Auto Insurance offers financial products and services to the military community, including competitive auto insurance. Though USAA products aren't available to everyone, those eligible won't find cheaper coverage elsewhere. Drivers who switched to USAA could save an average of $725 per year, according to USAA's website.\n\nUSAA offers standard car insurance options like liability, collision, comprehensive coverage, and uninsured and underinsured coverage. Optional coverage includes roadside assistance and rental reimbursement. USAA also sells home, pet, and life insurance, to name a few. So bundling insurance products is extremely common for military members and their families.\n\nUSAA also has plenty of discounts that only make sense for military members. For example, you could get up to a 15% discount when your vehicle is parked in a garage on base. You can also qualify for savings if you store your car or drive infrequently (which may apply to active duty military members being deployed).\n\nBundling home and auto insurance coverage with USAA gives policyholders a 10% discount. Setting up automatic payments for your car insurance premiums can reduce premiums by an additional 3%. If you insure two cars or more or your teen driver has good grades, you may be eligible for other discounts. USAA also has an app and offers 24/7 support online. USAA is unique in that whether you have a strong driving record or tickets and DUIs, USAA will still beat the nearest competitor's quote.\n\nState Farm auto insurance offers coverage across all 50 states and Washington, DC. It has comprehensive, collision, and liability coverage along with less common options like rideshare coverage.\n\nGiven the increased risk factors, car insurance for teen drivers can be costly. Teen drivers don't have the same levels of experience behind the wheel and may engage in risky driving behaviors. In fact, car crashes are the top cause of teen deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nExperts recommend adding any licensed driver in your home as soon as you know they'll drive your car regularly. State Farm Auto Insurance has excellent options for teen drivers. It offers a Good Student Discount of up to 25%. Also, you could get another discount if your teen driver is under 21 and takes a qualifying driver's ed course. There's also a unique option to save if your teen driver has a car at home but moved away for school through the Student Away at School Discount.\n\nThe Steer Clear discount offers young drivers below 25 up to a 15% discount with no at-fault accidents or moving violations in the previous three years. In addition, if you're willing to use State Farm's Drive Safe & Save app, you may qualify for up to a 30% discount.\n\nAlong with its liability, collision, and comprehensive coverage, State Farm offers emergency roadside service, rideshare coverage, and other auto coverages. You can work with one of its many insurance agents nationwide to find the best coverage for you and your teen driver.\n\nFarmers Auto Insurance is a full-service insurer offering home, life, business, and auto insurance with a long list of discounts compared to other insurance providers. Farmers offers up to 23 discounts when many other providers provide fewer than 12.\n\nPolicyholders paying premiums in full, senior drivers taking safe driving training, California drivers driving hybrids or electric vehicles, homeowners, good students, and young drivers are just a few groups enjoying discounts on auto insurance with Farmers. You also stand to save up to 20% by bundling plans or qualify for another discount insuring multiple vehicles.\n\nAlong with liability, collision, and comprehensive, Farmers offers umbrella policies to boost coverage on multiple plans (if you're bundling). All plans can be managed through the Farmers app.\n\nMany teachers enjoy lower prices, more perks, and greater customer satisfaction with Liberty Mutual Auto Insurance car insurance. The company has coverage for teachers, though some plans are unavailable in some states.\n\nPerks include a $0 deductible on collision coverage if you get into an accident during school hours or while working (ex: a coach driving to another school for an after-school sports game). Teachers also enjoy up to $2,500 in personal property coverage if teaching items or school-owned items are damaged or stolen. In addition, Liberty Mutual automatically applies a $0 deductible when qualifying cars are vandalized on school property or when driving on school-specific business.\n\nThrough Liberty Insurance, you can get typical collision or comprehensive coverage. It also offers optional coverages like original parts replacement coverage, gap coverage, 24-hour roadside assistance coverage, rental car reimbursement coverage, and more.\n\nUnlike competitors, Liberty Mutual also has a Liberty Mutual Deductible Fund®. You pay $30 toward the deductible fund each year, and Liberty Mutual drops your deductible by $100. If you file a claim, the fund can lower out-of-pocket costs. You can download the company's app to check in with your policy or file a claim.\n\nProgressive can save you hundreds on your auto insurance. Compare rates side by side to find out how much you could save.\n\nA highly ranked and long-standing insurance company, Progressive offers auto, home, motorcycle, and other insurance across the United States.\n\nAccidents happen, and the best car insurance companies can help. But rates inevitably rise after even a minor accident. Progressive Auto Insurance notably offers accident forgiveness to qualifying drivers. Its three types of accident forgiveness coverage include the following:\n\nYou can obtain liability, collision, and comprehensive coverage through Progressive. Interestingly, Progressive specifies if your pet is injured and you have collision coverage, your policy will cover some vet expenses.\n\nIt also offers gap coverage, rental car reimbursement coverage, custom parts and equipment value, rideshare coverage, and roadside assistance. Progressive also has a Name Your Price option that allows you to state your desired price, and the website will show what's available. You can also use their mobile app or contact Progressive agents for support.\n\nCoverage needs: Your needs will vary depending on your individual situation. You'll want to think about how often and how well you drive (be honest with yourself). You'll also want to think about the value of your car.\n\nGenerally, it's a good idea to go beyond state minimums and opt for full coverage, which can be a mix of liability, comprehensive, and collision car insurance to ensure you've covered your bases in a wide range of scenarios.\n\nExperts recommend going beyond the minimum liability coverage limits because the medical and property damage costs can go far beyond state minimums in a severe accident. Depending on the state, this could leave you vulnerable to more significant financial losses.\n\nBudget: Your budget will also play a large part in determining the right provider and policy. It may be beneficial to determine how much you can spend before you go about obtaining quotes from various providers.\n\nDiscounts: Going hand-in-hand with your budget, you'll want to consider the discounts that your provider of choice offers and what you'll qualify for. Perhaps you already have homeowners or renters insurance with a company, and you can secure a discount on your existing policies and your auto insurance if you bundle.\n\nCustomer service: You can assess how a car insurance company treats its customers by looking at reviews on third party sites like the Better Business Bureau or Trustpilot. You can also look at JD Power auto insurance customer satisfaction ratings in the region you live/drive in.\n\nYou should consider how you want to interact with your auto insurance company, be it online, over the phone with a live agent, or through a mobile app.\n\nTo determine the best auto insurance companies, we compare affordability, customer satisfaction, coverage options, optional coverage, benefits for policyholders, financial strength, and accessibility. No single factor accounts for everything consumers need; not all auto insurance companies are created the same.\n\nWe compared quotes, customer reviews, financial stability, and the company's history. With all these factors combined, we rate numerous competitors to see which companies rise to the top.\n\nAuto insurance, in particular, is primarily run on a state and regional basis. In short, most auto insurance providers are only licensed in some states. As such, the best car insurance companies for a driver in New York may differ from the best option for similar drivers in California.\n\nWe use numerous sources to get an objective view of each provider. Our reviews are not sponsored by the companies being reviewed. Each review reflects our opinion based solely on the facts gathered. Reviews may be updated as facts change (for example, JD Power rankings are updated when new reports are released).

    "title": "I went on an adults-only cruise for the first time, and 8 things surprised me",
    "content": "On board Royal Caribbean's Wonder of the Seas, many offerings were geared toward children, from waterslides to splash pads. With kids running around screaming on the pool deck, it was tough to relax. By the end of the trip, I was ready to give up cruising.\n\nThen, I heard about Virgin Voyages, a luxury, adults-only cruise line that first set sail in 2021. I thought sailing on an upscale ship free of children might change my mind about cruising, so I booked a seven-night Mediterranean cruise in August 2023 on Virgin Voyages' Valiant Lady ship. I stayed in a cabin with a balcony, and the starting rate was $5,910, though Business Insider received a media rate for the weeklong cruise.\n\nMy trip was far better than my first cruise. I sailed in peaceful luxury from Spain to Italy and France, and the ship was full of surprises.\n\nThe ship was more stylish than I could have imagined. Multicolored lighting, iridescent panels paired with bold artwork, and modern furniture gave it a futuristic feel. Pops of Virgin's signature bright red were everywhere, from furniture to accent pieces.\n\nColorful glows, from pink and purple to blue and green, lit the decks and elevators. I felt as if I were surrounded by rainbows. Simply wandering the ship renewed my sense of childlike wonder, yet no kids were in sight.\n\nI wasn't expecting my 225-square-foot cabin to feel spacious, but multipurpose furniture and clever storage hacks left me with enough floor space to stretch and move around.\n\nThe queen-size bed transformed into a couch during the day, an ottoman was tucked underneath the desk instead of a chair, and the nightstand was thin and light, making it easy to move out of the way when not in use.\n\nThe balcony had a side table, two chairs, and a big, netted hammock. Two years later, I'm still thinking about how peaceful I felt curled up in that hammock in the middle of the sea.\n\nThe last thing I expected to find on an adults-only cruise ship was a playground. But it wasn't just any playground — everything was jumbo-size, from the seesaws to the swings. It was clearly built for grown-ups.\n\nThe cruise ship playground was surrounded by fun activities, like a human-size chess set, a boxing ring, and a net suspended above an ocean view.\n\nIf there had been children around, I wouldn't have felt comfortable taking up space on this playground. Surrounded by only adults, however, I felt free to enjoy these activities.\n\nGoing on the swings and playing competitive games made me feel like a kid again. Simply playing refreshed my state of mind in a way I wasn't expecting, and I think all adults could use it on a vacation.\n\nWhen I wanted to beat the heat, I headed inside on deck seven, where I found a retro-style arcade and a game room full of board games, puzzles, and large tables to play on.\n\nThe board game selection was nostalgic — I spotted childhood favorites like Mouse Trap, Clue, and Cranium.\n\nWhile wandering the indoor shopping strip on deck six, I stopped in my tracks when I spotted Squid Ink, a tattoo parlor. Virgin Voyages says it's the first cruise line to offer tattooing on board. According to Cruise Gear, tattoo pricing starts at about $150.\n\nI love getting tattooed, so I was delighted by the shop, but I resisted the urge to get one on this trip.\n\nOn my first cruise on board Royal Caribbean's Wonder of the Seas, a lot of the food on the ship was included in the ticket price, but specialty restaurants incurred an additional price. Many cruise lines operate this way, so I was surprised to learn that none of the food on my Virgin Voyages cruise cost extra.\n\nThe all-inclusive dining was especially shocking, considering all the upscale restaurants on board, with offerings including Mediterranean seafood, fresh pasta, sushi, and steak. I indulged in the opportunity to forget about finances while dining.\n\nOn my first cruise, I spotted many people drinking and partying throughout the day, so I expected to see even more of that on an adults-only cruise. But the communal decks were calm during the day. It was easy to relax by the pools — one had music playing, while the other was silent.\n\nI talked to a bartender about my differing experiences, and they said Mediterranean cruisers tended to be less interested in partying than Caribbean cruisers.\n\nOn a luxury ship without kids, I expected to enjoy my adults-only cruise more than my first cruise. But I didn't expect the Virgin Voyages cruise to make me feel like a child myself.\n\nPlaying for hours surrounded by rainbows and eating whatever I wanted without thinking about money allowed me to let loose in a way I hadn't in over a decade.\n\nI would definitely cruise with Virgin Voyages again, and maybe next time I'll add some ink to my arm.\n\nBy continuing, I agree to receive newsletter and marketing emails from Business Insider and accept the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. You can opt out anytime via preference center or by clicking \"unsubscribe\" in any email. Notice of Financial Disclosure",

We may permit our Service Providers to use aggregate information which does not identify you or deidentified data for other purposes, consistent with applicable law.\n\nWe may provide personal information to third parties, such as advertising partners or other marketing partners who provide services to us.\n\nSome features of our Service may enable you to post content to social networking services (“SNSs”). If you choose to do this, we will provide information to such SNSs in accordance with your elections. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your use of those websites and that it is your responsibility to review the terms of use and privacy policy of the third party provider of such SNSs. We will not be responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such SNSs; (ii) the content, products or services on or availability of such SNSs; or (iii) your use of any such SNSs. Please refer to the “Social Media Services and Technology Integrations” section for more information on the use of Social Media.\n\nWe may also disclose your personal information to our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or Company Affiliates.\n\nWe may disclose your personal information to our clients in connection with us processing your personal information on their behalf. For example, if you subscribe to our newsletters and promotional communications, Business Insider or EMARKETER may send you content on behalf of their clients and disclose your personal information to such clients for their own marketing purposes.\n\nWe may disclose your personal information to our business partners in connection with offering you co-branded services, selling or distributing our products, or engaging in joint marketing activities. In addition, if you choose to participate in certain of our programs or to receive certain content we make available (e.g., webinar programs), we may disclose your information to participating sponsors, content providers, and related vendors in connection with such programs and content.\n\nWe may disclose your personal information to facilitate your requests such as when you choose to disclose information to a social network about your activities on the Service or participate in a business partner’s program.\n\nIn some cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a product or make payments (\"Payment Service\"). If you wish to purchase a product or make a payment using a Payment Service, you will be directed to a Payment Service webpage. Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any Payment Service’s use of information collected through any Payment Service. If you purchase one of our services, we and/or Payment Service provider(s) may use payment information to help provide the service you purchased. For example, payment information may be used to retrieve account information for a subscriber, to determine whether a subscriber is eligible for promotions, and to detect abuse of our services. In addition, for your convenience, we or our Payment Service provider(s) may enable your payment information to be accessible between Business Insider and EMARKETER in order to process your transaction more efficiently.\n\nWe may disclose personal information to vendors and other parties, for business and commercial purposes, including analytics and advertising technology companies that measure and improve our service, advertising effectiveness, and enable other enhancements on our website. Vendors or such other parties may act as our Service Providers, or in certain contexts, independently decide how to process your information. For more information on practices related to advertising and analytics, see the “Analytics and Advertising Technology” section below.\n\nWe reserve the right to disclose your information to respond to valid information requests from government authorities and judicial requests, to investigate potential fraud, or where otherwise required by law. We may disclose your personal information where we believe the disclosure is necessary or appropriate to comply with regulatory or legal requirements, or to protect the safety, rights, or property of ourselves and others and to exercise, establish, or defend our legal rights.\n\nCircumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, we may sell, transfer or otherwise disclose some or all of our assets, including your personal information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.\n\nWe may disclose your personal information at your direction or with your consent.\n\nWe may disclose personal information with the general public if you choose to disclose personal information when contributing content to our Service through forums, blogs, social features, or the like.\n\nWithout limiting the foregoing, in our sole discretion, we may disclose information, including aggregate data which does not identify you and/or deidentified personal information, to third parties or affiliates for any purpose except as prohibited by applicable law. To the extent we process deidentified personal information, as defined under applicable law, we will maintain and use that information in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify the information except as permitted by applicable law.\n\nOur Service contains links to, or content from, other parties' websites, products and services. The fact that we link to a website or display an advertisement or other parties' content is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with any of those other parties, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices.\n\nWe do not exercise control over other parties’ websites, products or services, and whether they store information in the U.S. or elsewhere. These other products and services may place their own cookies or other technologies on your computer or other device, collect data, or solicit information from you while you are exploring their websites, products, or services. Other persons and entities follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the information you submit to them or they collect from you. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those other parties.\n\nWe may offer blogs, social media profiles, message boards, bulletin boards, or similar public forums where you and other users of our Service can post content or otherwise communicate. If you post personal information on a public forum, we will assume you intend to make that personal information public. We may use your name to identify you with a posting in a public forum and may use your post on or in connection with our Service (e.g., when using a hashtag associated with Business Insider in a tweet or status update). Any personal information you disclose in a public forum is public information and may be seen or collected by other persons, including third parties that do not adhere to the standards set forth in this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for events that may arise from the distribution of any information you choose to publicly post or share through our online services.\n\nIn addition, to the extent you interact with social networks or other services through the Service (such as “liking” or “sharing” our content or otherwise connecting our Service to a social network), information collected and stored by those other parties through your interaction or pages that contain their tracking technologies remains subject to their policies and practices, including whether they disclose information about you to us, the types of information disclosed, and your choices on what is visible to others.\n\nWe are not responsible for and make no representations regarding the policies or business practices of any other parties or their services and encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.\n\nOur Service may contain tracking technologies owned and operated by other parties. For example, we use tracking technologies from analytics services, such as Google Analytics, to help us understand how users access and use the Service. Our app does not use these technologies for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes.\n\nWe may also work with ad networks, advertisers, agencies, and other technology services to place advertisements on our website and/or other websites and services. These parties may set and access cookies and other technologies on your personal computer and/or device and track certain behavioral information regarding users of your personal computer and/or device. As noted above, these website cookies and other technologies are set to, among other things: (a) track your activities across time and services for purposes of measuring conversions or actions you take, associating different devices you use, and serving ads and/or other content targeted to your interests (“Interest-based Advertising”); (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you.\n\nWe may also use audience matching services (which is a type of Interest-Based Advertising) to reach people (or similar audiences) who have visited our website or are identified in one or more of our databases. For example, we may disclose hashed email addresses to an ad partner to determine if there are common matching factors between our data and their data in order to serve you more personalized ads.\n\nAs discussed above, vendors and ad partners may act as our Service Providers, or in certain contexts, independently decide how to process your information. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use. For further information on your choices regarding these third party tracking technologies, please see the section entitled “Your Advertising Choices” below.\n\nCookies and location-identifying technologies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately. Also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy choices, such as enabling or disabling certain location-based services, by adjusting the permissions in your device. Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies some parts of the Service may not work and that when you revisit the Service your ability to limit browser-based tracking technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.\n\nYour browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, unless and until the law is interpreted to require us to do so, we do not monitor or take action with respect to “Do Not Track” signals or other mechanisms. We do, however, respond to global privacy preferences when required by law.\n\nYou may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going to https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and downloading the Google Analytics Opt Out Browser Add-on.\n\nSome of the advertisers and vendors that perform advertising-related services for us and our partners participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, visit https://www.aboutads.info/choices, and https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices for information on the DAA’s opt out program for mobile applications. Some of these companies are also members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). To learn more about the NAI and your opt out options for their members, see https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.\n\nPlease be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Business Insider is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third parties’ opt out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.\n\nAdditionally, we may collaborate with our service providers and identity partners (\"Identity Resolution Partners\") to deliver targeted advertising and identify the different devices and browsers you may use to access our Services. We and our Identity Resolution Partners may facilitate identity resolution by creating probabilistic and deterministic identifiers. These identifiers may use personal information, including your name, email address, phone number, and Activity Information to generate an online identifier reasonably linkable to you and/or your device or browser. For example, we may disclose hashed email address, phone number, or other information about your device to our Identity Resolution Partners, whom may, in turn, return an online identifier that we may store in a first party cookie or similar technology and disclose to our advertising partners to provide you a more personalized advertising experience. These identifiers also help us with fraud detection and security, enforce our Terms of Service, among other things. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our Identity Resolution Partners, which are separate from our own and not covered by this Privacy Policy.\n\nYou may have additional rights related to these technologies depending on your state of residency, as outlined in Section 12 below.\n\nIf you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive newsletters or promotional communications from us, please follow any unsubscribe instructions provided in our communications to you, update your user preferences via our subscription management tools on our Service, or contact us as set forth in the section below entitled “Contact Us”, and specify your request. Please note that you cannot opt out of non-promotional e-mails, and we may use your information to contact you with important notifications, such as notices with respect to purchases, safety, or changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Also, your unsubscribe is limited to the e-mail address or phone number used for that particular subscription and will not affect subsequent subscriptions.\n\nResidents of Applicable States (as defined above), the European Economic Area, and the United Kingdom, have specific rights with respect to our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. Please review our location-specific sections below for more information about those rights.\n\nWe employ appropriate security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Please be advised, however, that while we strive to protect your information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and are not responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your information.\n\nIf you suspect unauthorized use of personal information that you have provided us – such as your account information or its credentials – you should notify us immediately using the information in the Contact Us section of this Privacy Policy.\n\nWe will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law. Remember that even after you cancel your account, or if you ask us to delete your personal information, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances where, for example, you have shared information with social media or other services. Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others. We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancellation or your request for deletion, for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security or recordkeeping policies. It may not always be possible to completely remove or delete all of your information due to technical constraints or contractual, financial or legal requirements.\n\nOur Services are hosted in and managed from the United States. If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information processed in the United States or in any other country in which we have facilities or in which we engage service providers. The United States and other countries’ data protection laws may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in the United States may be entitled to access your personal information.\n\nTo the extent that the Company offers products and services to individuals located in the European Economic Area or United Kingdom, or to the extent the Service is deliberately made available to such individuals, please review the section titled “Additional Disclosures for Data Subjects in Europe and United Kingdom” below for more information about disclosures and privacy rights associated with that activity.\n\nWe reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make changes, we will revise this Privacy Policy to reflect such changes and revise the effective date included at the beginning of this policy. We may provide you with additional notice (such as to your e-mail address) if the changes are material. Your use of the Service following any such notice will signify and constitute your assent to and acceptance of such revised Privacy Policy.\n\nIf you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, including our compliance with applicable law, please feel free to contact us.\n\nEMARKETER directly:\n\nBy e-mail at privacy@emarketer.com.\n\nBusiness Insider directly:\n\nBy e-mail at privacy@businessinsider.com.\n\nFor EU specific questions, please email us at euprivacy@businessinsider.com.\n\nIf you have a disability and would like to access this Privacy Policy in an alternative format, please review the Insider Inc. Accessibility Statement.\n\nDepending on where you live, you may have certain additional rights regarding your personal information. This section provides information for consumers residing in Applicable States, in connection with the laws in those states, and other states with similar privacy laws (“Applicable Laws”). Under these Applicable Laws, and for purposes of this Section, “Personal Data” and/or “Personal Information” generally mean information that identifies, relates to, or describes a resident in one of the Applicable States and, depending on the state of residency, may also include information that is linkable or linked to a device. Personal information does not include publicly available information; lawfully obtained, truthful information that is a matter of public concern; information that has been deidentified or aggregated; or other information covered by certain sector-specific privacy laws, as consistent with state law. We do not reidentify Personal Data and/or Personal Information that has been deidentified. We and our advertising partners use certain Personal Data and/or Personal Information to deliver online advertisements to you on your devices tailored to your interests when you visit our website. This may be considered “sharing” or “selling” and/or \"targeted advertising\" under the laws of Applicable States. This Section provides details about the categories of Personal Data and/or Personal Information of consumers in Applicable States that we have collected, disclosed, processed for purposes of targeted advertising, “shared”, or “sold” during the last 12 months, as well as rights consumers have under Applicable Laws.\n\nAny capitalized term used and not otherwise defined below has the meaning assigned to it in our Privacy Policy.\n\nThe categories of Personal Data and/or Personal Information that we collected, disclosed, “shared”, “sold”, or processed for targeted advertising, as defined under Applicable Laws, are below, along with the purposes for processing, and categories of third parties to whom each category of Personal Data and/or Personal Information was disclosed, “shared”, “sold”, or processed for the purpose of targeted advertising. Please note that we process some categories of Personal Data and/or Personal Information in connection with targeted advertising, which could be considered “sharing” or “selling” as under the laws of certain Applicable States. Depending on how you interact with us, we may not have processed Personal Data and/or Personal Information about you for each (or any) of these purposes. Additionally, we do not knowingly sell, share, or process for purposes of targeted advertising Personal Data and/or Personal Information of children under 16 years of age.\n\nWe have provided detailed descriptions below on the data collection, use, and disclosure practices of our companies depending on which service you use.\n\nPlease note that we may process Personal Data and/or Personal Information in each of the above categories in order to protect ours and others’ rights, and/or to complete a merger or sale of assets or other corporate transactions. Please note that we do not sell Personal Data and/or Personal Information for monetary consideration.\n\nUnder Applicable Laws, “sale” and/or “share” does not include, for example, the transfer of Personal Data and/or Personal Information as an asset that is part of a merger, bankruptcy, or other similar transaction involving all or any portion of our business.\n\nIn general, we only collect Personal Data and/or Personal Information that is reasonably necessary for and proportional to the purposes for which we process it. We collect this Personal Data and/or Personal Information directly from residents of Applicable States themselves, as well as from social media platforms (e.g., if the individual has connected a social media account to our website); referrals; joint marketing, co-branding, co-promotional, or advertising partners; and sources of demographic and other information, including through devices you used to interact with us through our Services. All sources of personal information collected are noted in the “Information Collection” section above.\n\nWe will retain Personal Data and/or Personal Information from or about you as reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve the purpose(s) for which the Personal Information was collected or processed as outlined in this Section unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.\n\nWe do not process “sensitive” Personal Information for purposes other than those permitted by applicable law (such as, in California, to provide the services and for security purposes).\n\nWe may use this personal information for the following purposes, including commercial purposes:\n\nto operate, manage, and maintain our business;\n\nto provide our Services;\n\nto accomplish our business purposes and objectives;\n\nto allow you to participate in panels, events, sweepstakes and contests, and   carry out the transactions you have requested;\n\nto develop, improve, repair, and maintain our Services;\n\nto engage in targeted advertising on our website and marketing;\n\nto conduct research and analytics;\n\nto take quality assurance and safety assurance measures;\n\nto conduct risk assessments and effectuate security controls;\n\nto deliver video content in the ordinary course of business;\n\nto detect and prevent fraud;\n\nto verify your identity;\n\nto conduct audits and other internal functions;\n\nto comply with the law, legal process, and internal policies;\n\nto maintain records; and\n\nto exercise and defend legal claims.\n\nDepending on your interactions with us, we may not have used Personal Data and/or Personal Information collected about that resident for each (or any) of these purposes.\n\nIf you are a resident of an Applicable State, you may have the following rights with respect to any information about you that constitutes “Personal Information” or “Personal Data” depending on your state of residence.\n\nWe are required by law to verify your identity in connection with any request in order to prevent unauthorized access of your data. Failure to verify your identity may result in your request not being processed. Where required by applicable law, we will notify you if we deny your request and notify you of the reasons we are unable to honor your request and any available appeal processes available to you.\n\nRight to Know and Access: You may request to access the following information we have collected and maintained about you in a portable form:\n\nThe specific pieces of Personal Data and/or Personal Information we collected about you;\n\nThe categories of Personal Data and/or Personal Information we collected about you and the categories of sources;\n\nThe business or commercial purpose for collecting, disclosing, or selling Personal Data and/or Personal Information about you; and,\n\nThe categories of Personal Data and/or Personal Information about you that we sold, shared, or otherwise disclosed and the categories of third parties (or, depending on your state of residence, a list of specific third parties) to whom we sold, shared, or otherwise disclosed that Personal Data and/or Personal Information.\n\nPlease note that, in some instances, we may decline to honor your request or only honor your request in part, where, for example, we are unable to verify your identity or an exception to this right applies.\n\nRight to Delete: You may request that we delete the Personal Data and/or Personal Information we have collected from you. Please note that, in some instances, we may decline to honor your request or only honor your request in part, where, for example, we are unable to verify your identity or an exception to this right applies.\n\nOpt Out of “Sale”, “Shares”, and Targeted Advertising: Depending on the state you reside in, website users have the right to opt out of the “sale” of your data and the disclosure of your data for cross-context behavioral advertising/targeted advertising (known as a “share” in California). We also honor alternative opt out signals, such as the GPC. We process opt out preference signals in a frictionless manner. Please note that we do not sell Personal Information and/or Personal Data for monetary consideration.\n\nRight to Correction: You have a right to request the correction of inaccurate Personal Data and/or Personal Information that we may have on file about you. Please note that, in some instances, we may decline to honor your request or only honor your request in part, where, for example, we are unable to verify your identity or an exception to this right applies.\n\nRight to Non-Discrimination: You have the right to be free from unlawful discrimination for exercising your above-listed rights under Applicable Laws.\n\nRight to Appeal:Depending on your state of residence, you may have the right to request an appeal of a denied consumer request. Please see below for how to submit an appeal.\n\nIn order to exercise your Right to Opt Out of “Sales”, “Shares”, and Targeted Advertising, for Business Insider, please visit our \"Your Privacy Choices\" page here.

If we are unable to verify your identity, we may deny your requests to know, correct, or delete.\n\nIf personal information about you has been processed by us as a service provider on behalf of a client and you wish to exercise any rights you have with such personal information, please inquire with our client directly. If you wish to make your request directly to us, please provide the name of our client on whose behalf we processed your personal information. We will refer your request to that client and will support them to the extent required by applicable law in responding to your request.\n\nDepending on your state of residence, you may have the Right to Appeal the denial of a request. In order to exercise your Right to Appeal, please email us at privacy@businessinsider.com for Business Insider and privacy@emarketer.com for EMARKETER.\n\nDepending on state of residence, consumers may have the right to submit a request through an authorized agent. If you are an authorized agent acting on behalf of a consumer to exercise a privacy right discussed in this policy, you must be able to demonstrate that you have the requisite authorization to act on behalf of the consumer. We may also contact the consumer directly to verify his or her own identity and that the consumer granted you authorization to act on their behalf as an authorized agent. Depending on the Applicable State, an authorized agent may also be permitted to act on behalf of a consumer in order to exercise certain opt-out rights. If you are an authorized agent trying to exercise rights on behalf of a consumer, please contact us at the contact information above with supporting verification information, which should include proof that you have the consumer’s authorization to act. Under certain circumstances, we may also require you to prove and verify your identity if you are acting as an authorized agent on behalf of a consumer.\n\nWe offer incentives on products or services, such as discounts or exclusive offers, by enrolling in newsletters or other programs (\"Program\"). The Program may be considered a financial incentive or loyalty program under certain Applicable Laws. Participation in the Program is entirely voluntary. If you would like to participate in the Program, please opt-in by signing up. If you sign up, you will receive:\n\nA discount; and/or\n\nExclusive deals and independent product reviews.\n\nWhen you decide to participate in the Program, we will collect your name, email, and/or country (depending on which you voluntarily provide to us) (collectively, \"Registration Information\"). Registration Information may also be disclosed to Service Providers or other providers or partners that support our operational business purposes. By voluntarily opting into this Program, you will receive a discount, access to exclusive deals and independent product reviews, and/or you may also receive content from us through email.\n\nIf you decide you no longer wish to participate in the Program, you may withdraw at any time by sending an email to privacy@businessinsider.com or privacy@emarketer.com, as applicable.\n\nWe estimate that the value of your data is equal to the value of the discount provided and/or access to exclusive deals and independent product reviews. Registration Information enables us to deliver personalized content, offers, discounts, and value to you, which enables us to establish a relationship with you, and is valued by Business Insider in order to facilitate a positive customer experience. In determining the value of the Registration Information, we consider the profit generated from purchasing goods from us and our advertising partners that includes personal information, which is reasonably correlated to the value provided to you through personalized content, discounts, or offers.\n\nOur California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) metrics for the previous calendar year are as follows:\n\nNumber of requests to delete that were received, complied with in whole or in part, and denied: 623\n\nNumber of requests to correct that were received, complied with in whole or in part, and denied: 2\n\nNumber of requests to opt out of sale/sharing that were received, complied with in whole or in part, and denied: 89\n\nThe median or mean number of days it took to substantively respond (i.e not the 10 day “confirmation of receipt” window); 15.50 days\n\nCustomers who are residents of California may request (i) a list of the categories of personal information disclosed by us to third parties during the immediately preceding calendar year for those third parties’ own direct marketing purposes; and (ii) a list of the categories of third parties to whom we disclosed such information. To exercise a request, please write us at the email or postal address set out in “Contact Us” section above and specify that you are making a “California Shine the Light Request.” We may require additional information from you to allow us to verify your identity and are only required to respond to requests once during any calendar year.\n\nThis section applies to any individuals located within the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, or any jurisdiction to which similar privacy laws apply, from whom we may have collected personal data from any source, including through your use of our Services.  We provide this Notice to comply with applicable privacy laws, including the General Data Protection Act (“GDPR”), the UK GDPR, and related laws, regulations, and guidance from the European Union and/or its member states.  Any capitalized term used and not otherwise defined below has the meaning assigned to it in our Privacy Policy.\n\nFor the purposes of this Notice, “personal data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.\n\nEU and UK data protection law makes a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as “data controllers”) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as “data processors”). Both Business Insider and EMARKETER may act as either a data controller or a data processor in respect of your personal data, depending on the circumstances. We generally act as data controller with respect to information you provide through the Service. Sometimes we operate as a data processor on behalf of a client, a separate legal entity, which is the data controller. For example, if you subscribe to our newsletters and promotional communications, we may send you content on behalf of our clients and share your personal data with our clients for their own marketing purposes. Please visit the applicable client’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. Any questions that you may have relating to such personal data and your rights under data protection law should therefore be directed to the client as the data controller, not to Business Insider or EMARKETER.\n\nWe rely on one or more legal bases to process your personal data under applicable law.  We may process personal data (i) as necessary to perform our contractual obligations to you, including, but not limited to, those obligations in our terms of use; (ii) as necessary to pursue our legitimate interests as further detailed below; (iii) as necessary for our compliance with our legal obligations such as a request or order from courts, law enforcement or other government authorities; and/or (iv) with your consent, including to send you marketing email messages and other information that may be of interest to you, which you may withdraw at any time.\n\nWe may collect, process, and maintain personal data to pursue the legitimate business interests outlined below.  To determine these legitimate interests, we balance our legitimate interests against the legitimate interests and rights of you and others and only process personal data in accordance with those interests where they are not overridden by your data-protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.\n\nWhile our legitimate interests are most extensively detailed in Section 3 of this Privacy Policy, they generally include:\n\nProvide, improve, and develop our Service, including to deliver your requested Services, send you messages and provide user support, customize the Services to better fit your needs as a user, develop new Services, and perform internal analytics and research and development. This also includes sharing personal data with our trusted service providers that provide services on our behalf.\n\nProtect you and others and to create and maintain a trusted environment, such as to comply with our legal obligations, to ensure compliance our agreements with you and other third parties, to ensure safe, secure, and reliable Services, and to detect and prevent wrongdoing and crime, assure compliance with our policies, and protect and defend our rights, interests, and property. In connection with the activities above, we may conduct internal research and profiling based on your interactions on various Sites, content you submit to the Sites, and information obtained from third parties.\n\nProvide, personalize, measure and improve our marketing, including to send you promotional messages and other information that may be of interest to you with your consent. We may also use personal data to understand our user base and the effectiveness of our marketing.  This processing is done pursuant to our legitimate interest in undertaking marketing activities to offer products or services that may be of interest to you.\n\nIf you are a data subject in a jurisdiction identified in this section, you have the right to access, rectify, or erase any personal data we have collected about you through the Service. You also have the right to data portability and the right to restrict or object to our processing of personal data we have collected about you through the Service. In addition, you have the right to ask us not to process your personal data (or provide it to third parties to process) for marketing purposes or purposes materially different than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. You may withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing we do based on consent you have provided to us.\n\nTo exercise any of these rights, please fill out our Data Subject Request form or contact us at privacy@businessinsider.com and specify which right you intend to exercise. For EMARKETER, please email your request at privacy@emarketer.com. We will respond to your request within 30 days. We may require additional information from you to allow us to confirm your identity. Further, if we are processing your information on behalf of one of our clients, we will refer you to that client, and will support them to the extent required by applicable law in responding to your request. Please note that we store information as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, and may continue to retain and use the information even after a data subject request for purposes of our legitimate interests, including as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our agreements.\n\nIf you have any issues with our compliance or you believe that we have not complied with our obligations under this Privacy Policy or European or UK law, you have the right to make a complaint to an EU Data Protection Authority, such as the UK Information Commissioner's Office.

    "content": "There's an ideal travel credit card for every type of traveler, whether you're just dipping your toe into the world of travel rewards or have flown around the world on points.\n\nBusiness Insider evaluated dozens of travel rewards credit cards from national credit card issuers to identify the best options for new applicants, considering factors such as the welcome bonus, ongoing rewards, perks, and annual fees.\n\nWe picked the best travel rewards credit cards by weighing the value of each card's range of benefits against its annual fee to decide if\n\nEarn 5 points on travel purchased through Chase Travel℠. Earn 3 points on dining, select streaming services and online groceries. Earn 2 points on all other travel purchases. Earn 1 points on all other purchases.\n\nIf you're new to travel rewards credit cards or just don't want to pay hundreds in annual fees, the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card is a smart choice. It earns bonus points on a wide variety of travel and dining purchases and offers strong travel and purchase coverage, including primary car rental insurance.\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card is our top-choice travel credit card for most people because it strikes the perfect balance between strong benefits and a moderate annual cost.\n\nEven infrequent travelers can easily justify the $95 annual fee with an annual statement credit of up to $50 off eligible hotel bookings through the Chase Travel℠, and a 10% point bonus each year on your card renewal anniversary.\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card earns 5 points on travel purchased through Chase Travel℠, 3 points on dining, select streaming services and online groceries, 2 points on all other travel purchases, and 1 point on all other purchases.\n\nWhile these earning rates are generous, the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card shines most with top-notch travel insurance benefits on par with premium travel rewards cards with far higher annual fees.\n\nWhen you pay for travel expenses with this card and meet certain requirements, you can request reimbursement for unexpected expenses that may arise when your flight is delayed or if your baggage is delayed or lost. You'll also enjoy primary rental car insurance coverage, so you won't have to file claims through your personal car insurance plan or pay for coverage from the rental car company.\n\nWhat we love: High welcome bonus offer, bonus points on travel, dining, and online grocery purchases, redeem points for 1.25 cents apiece for travel or through Chase Travel℠ for 25% value bonus\n\nWhat we don't love: Doesn't offer upscale travel perks such as airport lounge access and a statement credit for Global Entry\n\nEarn 5 miles per dollar on hotels, vacation rentals, and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel. Earn unlimited 2 miles per dollar on every purchase.\n\nIf you want an easy, no-fuss travel rewards credit card, the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card is a great fit. For a moderate annual fee, it offers plenty of value, useful benefits, and a substantial welcome bonus.\n\nThe Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card is a great \"set it and forget it\" card for people who value simplicity when earning and redeeming travel rewards.\n\nCardholders earn 5 miles per dollar on hotels, vacation rentals and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel and unlimited 2 miles per dollar on every other purchase.\n\nCapital One cardholders can use their miles to pay off eligible travel purchases on their recent card statements at a rate of 1 cent per mile.\n\nAlternatively, you can transfer Capital One rewards to more than a dozen frequent flyer and hotel loyalty programs. Finally, you can also book flights, hotels, and other reservations directly through the Capital One travel portal and use miles to pay at checkout.\n\nCapital One Venture Rewards Cardholders can also book Capital One Lifestyle Collection Hotels worldwide for elite benefits such as a $50 hotel experience credit, room upgrades when available, and early check-in/late checkout when available. Cardholders also get up to a $120 Global Entry/TSA PreCheck® application fee credit once every four years.\n\nWhat we love: Use your miles to cover your recent travel expenses, easy rewards of at least 2 miles per dollar on non bonus purchases\n\nWhat we don't love: Other cards offer higher rewards on certain spending categories such as travel and dining.\n\nEarn 5 miles per dollar on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel. Earn unlimited 1.25 miles on every purchase.\n\n0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for 15 months (intro fee of 3% for the first 15 months, then 4% of the amount of each balance transfer at a promotional APR that Capital One may offer you at any other time)\n\nThe VentureOne Rewards Card is a slimmed-down version of the popular Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card. It's one of the few no-annual-fee cards on the market that gives you the option to redeem miles for cash back or transfer them to travel partners.\n\nThe Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card is our favorite travel credit card without an annual fee, and it offers many of the same perks as the Capital One Venture Rewards Card we just reviewed.\n\nThe VentureOne Rewards Card earns 1.25 miles per dollar on most purchases, compared to the 2 miles per dollar its bigger \"sibling\" earns. But the trade-off is that you don't have to pay an annual fee. You can also earn the same 5 points per dollar on hotels and car rentals booked through Capital One Travel.\n\nCardholders can also transfer rewards to Capital One's airline and hotel partners — a rare benefit for a credit card with no annual fee. You'll also enjoy a handful of benefits including car rental insurance, travel accident insurance, and purchase assurance, making this card a permanent star in our guide to the best Capital One credit cards.\n\nThe VentureOne Rewards Card is also a solid pick if you want a zero-interest credit card: New cardholders get a 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for 15 months (intro fee of 3% for the first 15 months, then 4% of the amount of each balance transfer at a promotional APR that Capital One may offer you at any other time), then a 19.24% - 29.24% Variable APR.\n\nEarn unlimited 10 miles on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel. Earn 5 miles on flights and vacation rentals booked through Capital One Travel. Earn unlimited 2 miles on all other purchases.\n\nThe Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card is one of the best credit cards for frequent travelers, with top-notch benefits and a wide range of built-in protections. It comes with a generous welcome bonus and credits that can help offset the annual fee — which is much lower than similar premium cards.\n\nOur third Capital One recommendation in a row is the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card, which is best for families because it comes with premium travel perks for the whole household.\n\nThis sleek metal credit card is loaded with premium benefits including airport lounge access and an annual travel credit of up to $300, which more than offsets its $395 annual fee. Cardholders also get a 10,000-mile bonus on each account anniversary worth $100 toward travel.\n\nFamilies who frequently rent cars for travel can come out way ahead with this card, which earns 10 miles on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel, 5 miles per dollar on flights and vacation rentals booked through Capital One Travel, and 2 miles on all other purchases.\n\nAs with other cards that earn Capital One miles, cardholders can transfer rewards to over a dozen airline and hotel partners to book award travel, use miles to book through the Capital One Travel Portal.\n\nWhat we don't love: The $300 credit is relatively restrictive and only applies to travel booked through Capital One\n\nEarn 5 points on flights and 10 total points on hotels and car rentals when you purchase travel through Chase Travel℠ immediately after the first $300 is spent on travel purchases annually. Earn 3 points on other travel and dining & 1 point per $1 spent on all other purchases.\n\nIf you're new to rewards credit cards you may want to start elsewhere, but if you know you want to earn Chase points and you spend a lot on travel and dining, the Sapphire Reserve is one of the most rewarding options.\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Reserve® is one of the best credit cards for people who buy travel insurance or enjoy adventure trips. This card comes with complimentary benefits for emergency evacuation and medical care, with sky-high coverage limit surpassing most standard policies you can buy.\n\nIn addition to providing the best credit card travel insurance for worst-case scenarios, the Chase Sapphire Reserve® also protects you financially after mid-sized mishaps such as delayed or lost baggage and canceled or disrupted travel. Simply file a claim and submit all relevant information about the issue, and you'll be reimbursed for eligible incidents.\n\nThis card has a $550 annual fee, which is why we no longer recommend this card for everyone. But if you travel often or aggressively enough to consider buying an annual travel insurance policy, this card can be worth its annual fee many times over.\n\nCardholders also get complimentary airport lounge access to Chase Sapphire Lounges and the Priority Pass™ network of over 1,500 airport lounges worldwide (membership requires enrollment to activate). You'll also get a generous annual credit of up to $300 toward a broad range of travel expenses, from airfare to highway tolls.\n\nCardholders earn 5 points per dollar on air travel purchased through Chase Travel℠, 10 points on hotels and car rentals purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards® (except on purchases that trigger the $300 travel credit), and 3 points per dollar on other travel and dining. Finally, you'll also receive monthly DoorDash benefits that can save you money on delivery (activation required), including complimentary DashPass membership.\n\nWhen redeeming points, you can book flights, hotels, and rental cars through Chase Travel℠ at a rate of 1.5 cents per point — a 50% bonus over the standard 1-cent-per-point rate. You can also transfer your rewards to travel partners like Hyatt, Marriott, Southwest, and United.\n\nWhat we love: Annual $300 travel credit, airport lounge access, and stellar travel insurance benefits\n\nThe Citi Strata Premier℠ Card isn't as flashy or well-known as some other travel cards, but it's perfect for people who want a single credit card for earning bonus rewards from common household expenses.\n\nCardholders earn a whopping 10 Citi ThankYou points per dollar on hotels, rental cars, and attractions booked through Citi Travel. They also earn 3 points on air travel and at gas stations, restaurants, supermarkets, and hotels, and 1 point per dollar on everything else.\n\nWhen booking hotels through Citi Travel, cardholders also get an annual credit of $100 off a single hotel stay of $500 or more before taxes and fees.\n\nWhat we don't love: Mediocre travel insurance benefits, few travel perks compared to similar rewards cards\n\nEarn 4X Membership Rewards® points per dollar spent on purchases at restaurants worldwide, on up to $50,000 in purchases per calendar year, then 1X points for the rest of the year. Earn 4X Membership Rewards® points per dollar spent at US supermarkets, on up to $25,000 in purchases per calendar year, then 1X points for the rest of the year. Earn 3X Membership Rewards® points per dollar spent on flights booked directly with airlines or on AmexTravel.com. Earn 2X Membership Rewards® points per dollar spent on prepaid hotels and other eligible purchases booked on AmexTravel.com. Earn 1X Membership Rewards® point per dollar spent on all other eligible purchases.\n\nEarn 60,000 Membership Rewards® Points after you spend $6,000 on eligible purchases on your new card in your first six months of Card Membership\n\nFoodies and travelers alike will appreciate the American Express Gold's generous welcome bonus and Membership Rewards points earning. Its Uber Cash credits are useful for rides and Uber Eats, and monthly dining credits with participating merchants like GrubHub and Seamless are easy to use.\n\nThe American Express® Gold Card is an ideal travel card for foodies who both dine out and cook at home. Unfortunately, its annual fee of $325 is quite steep, especially for a card that doesn't offer airport lounge access (rates and fees).\n\nCardholders earn Amex points very quickly: 4 Membership Rewards® points on purchases at restaurants worldwide (on up to $50,000 in purchases per calendar year, then 1 point), 4 points at US supermarkets (on up to $25,000 in purchases per calendar year, then 1 point), 3 points on flights booked directly with airlines or on AmexTravel.com, 2 points on prepaid hotels and other eligible purchases booked on AmexTravel.com, and 1 point on all other eligible purchases. Terms apply.\n\nYou can come out ahead on the card's annual fee if you can maximize most or all of the Amex Gold Card's annual credits. These include up to $100 a year for Resy restaurants (in $50 bi-annual allotments), plus monthly credits for purchases at select partners including Dunkin' after enrollment.\n\nCardholders also get up to $120 Uber Cash credit ($10 per month) toward rides and Uber Eats each calendar year when the American Express® Gold Card is added to your Uber account when enrolled. Terms apply.\n\nOn the bright side, this card doesn't charge foreign transaction fees so you can bring it along on international trips (rates and fees).\n\nEarn unlimited 5X points on hotels, 4X points on airlines, 3X points on other travel and restaurants, and 1X points on other purchases.\n\nThe Wells Fargo Autograph Journey℠ Card is a true travel credit card, with benefits that rival many of the best travel rewards credit cards currently on the market. This card has a low annual fee on par with that of popular competing credit cards and Wells Fargo's also has a Points Transfer program that allows cardholders to juice maximum value from every point they earn.\n\nThe Wells Fargo Autograph Journey℠ Card is best for travelers who value the hotel destination as well as the journey itself, since it earns 5 points per dollar on hotel bookings. Cardholders also earn 4 points per dollar on flights and 3 points per dollar on restaurants and other travel purchases.\n\nThis card has a $95 annual fee, inviting direct comparisons to two other cards on this list: the Chase Sapphire Preferred and the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card. Unfortunately, the Wells Fargo Autograph Journey℠ Card isn't as strong as either competitor — yet — when it comes to Wells Fargo Autograph transfer partners. But Wells Fargo's transferrable credit card rewards program is relatively new, and may add new airline and hotel partners with time.\n\nWells Fargo Autograph Journey℠ Card cardholders can redeem rewards at the standard redemption rate of 1 cent per point for cash back, or transfer their rewards to any travel partners above for additional value.\n\nEarn 5 Membership Rewards® Points for flights booked directly with airlines or with American Express Travel (up to $500,000 per calendar year) and on prepaid hotels booked with American Express Travel. Earn 1 Point on other purchases.\n\nIf you want as many premium travel perks as possible, The Platinum Card® from American Express could be the right card for you. The annual fee is high, but you get a long list of benefits such as airport lounge access, travel statement credits, and more.\n\nThe Platinum Card® from American Express is arguably the most prestigious card available to most people without a personalized invitation.\n\nThis swanky status symbol has a distinctive look and feel, with one of the highest annual fees of any travel card (rates and fees). But it offers far more than appearances, and can be well worth the cost if you can utilize most or all of the card's statement credits each year.\n\nCardholders earn 5 points per dollar on flights when you book directly through the airline or through American Express Travel (on up to $500,000 per calendar year), which makes the card a great choice for purchasing airfare. It also earn 5 points on prepaid hotels booked with American Express Travel and only earns 1 point per dollar on all other purchases, so pick a different card for dining rewards, groceries, gas, or online shopping.\n\nThe Amex Platinum Card offers more airport lounge access than any other personal travel card. In addition to complimentary Priority Pass membership (enrollment required), you get access to Amex Centurion Lounges, 10 annual visits to Delta Sky Clubs (unlimited visits after spending $75,000 or more in a calendar year), and more. Terms apply.\n\nThe card's annual statement credits can also go a long way toward offsetting the high annual fee. Most require prior enrollment to activate their benefits:\n\nWhat we love: Lots of luxury benefits, including airport lounge access and statement credits with Uber and Saks\n\nThe One Key™ Card is ideal for people who frequently book short-term vacation home rentals through Vrbo.\n\nIt's also great for travelers who use Hotels.com and Expedia, since it earns 3% in OneKeyCash™ on Expedia, Hotels.com, and Vrbo purchases and at gas stations, grocery stores, and on dining, and 1.5% on all other purchases.\n\nThis card actually comes in two versions: the no-annual fee One Key™ Card, or the $99 One Key+™ Card      \n                  . You can't go wrong with either card, so you should make your decision based on auxiliary perks.\n\nBoth cards earn 3% back in OneKeyCash per dollar spent on bookings at Vrbo, Hotels.com, and Expedia, as well as on purchases at gas stations, restaurants, groceries, and food delivery services. But the One Key™ Card earns just 1.5% back on all other purchases, while the One Key+™ Card earns 2% back on all other purchases.\n\nYou can offset the $99 annual fee on the One Key+™ Card with a $100 anniversary credit in OneKeyCash, as well as a statement credit of up to $120 toward Global Entry or TSA PreCheck® enrollment fees once every four years.\n\nWe recommend the One Key™ Card for casual travelers, and the One Key+™ Card for reward maximizers who don't mind doing a little extra work for travel benefits.\n\nTravel credit cards reward their cardholders with bonus points on travel-related expenses, and offer travel-related insurance benefits and purchase protections.\n\nThere's a card designed for people seeking free flights, hoping for free hotel stays, or just doing whatever it takes to realize their dreams of relaxing in an overwater bungalow. There are even no-annual-fee travel credit cards that won't cost you anything to maintain.\n\nRedeeming points or miles requires more effort than using simple cash back. But the upside is that you can get much more value for your points compared to simply cashing in your rewards for a statement credit or check at a rate of 1 cent per point.\n\nIn fact, it's possible to receive double, triple, or even more than that amount when you're strategic about how you redeem your rewards, particularly if you book expensive luxury hotels or first-class flights.\n\nThe right travel credit card can help you unlock incredible flights and hotel stays worth thousands of dollars apiece.\n\nIn this guide, we've focused mostly on the best travel credit cards that earn transferable points. Transferable points include popular currencies such as:\n\nYou can transfer these points to both airline and hotel partner loyalty programs. You can even redeem your points to offset the cash price of your travel at a flat rate.\n\nBusiness Insider's guide to points and miles valuations can help you determine what your airline miles, hotel points, and credit card rewards are worth.\n\nThe first rule of utilizing credit cards is to never carry a balance that incurs interest, because high fees will quickly eliminate any net gains from earning travel rewards.\n\nIf you do have to carry a balance, consider getting one of the best balance transfer credit cards with 0% intro APR, so you can pay down what you owe without paying a lot of interest.\n\nMany of the best credit cards offer rotating benefits or periodic credits, such as The Platinum Card® from American Express's semi-annual Saks credit (activation required) or the Chase Sapphire Reserve®'s annual travel credit.\n\nBusiness Insider evaluated dozens of travel credit cards currently available to new applicants, and narrowed down the list to the best options recommended here based on the following factors:\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Reserve® is a fantastic choice for people who want a single credit card for well-rounded premium benefits, and who don't mind paying a generous annual fee to get it. The card comes with the best complimentary travel insurance available from a credit card, as well as an annual travel credit of up to $300 that can be used on most types of travel.\n\nThere are two main types of travel credit cards: bank-issued cards that earn points you can transfer to travel partners, and co-branded credit cards issued in partnership with specific airlines and hotels. Transferable reward currencies include Amex points, Capital One miles, and Chase Ultimate Rewards® points. Airline credit cards and hotel credit cards earn points or miles within a respective hotel or airline program.\n\nEligibility and Benefit level varies by Card.

    "title": "Best Money Market Rates for April 2025: Top Accounts, Features, and Benefits",
    "content": "Business Insider's personal finance team reviewed over 120 financial institutions to find the money market accounts with the highest interest rates. Top money market accounts currently pay comparable interest rates to the best high-yield savings accounts, making them a decent alternative for your savings.\n\nThe highest money market account rate goes up to 4.41% APY. This APY is offered on the TotalBank Online Money Market.\n\nTop-rated money market accounts for savers have manageable fees and standout features, like ATM access or check-writing abilities. These accounts also have the most competitive money market account rates nationwide. You can learn more about the best high-yield money market accounts.\n\nTotalBank offers a great rate for its TotalBank Online Money Market account. It also charges no monthly service fee, making it a good choice if you don't want to pay if you can't meet a minimum balance.\n\nThat being said, you need to keep at least $2,500 in the account to earn interest. As long as you meet that requirement, you'll earn the account's highest interest rate on your funds up to the account's maximum amount, $1,000,000. To get started, you'll need to deposit a sizable minimum opening deposit of $25,000.\n\nIf you're looking for a money market account that offers several ways for you to withdraw money, you might want to consider some of our other top picks instead. This account doesn't come with checks, ATM cards, or debit cards, and you're limited to six fee-free withdrawals per month.\n\nYou may like First Internet Bank of Indiana if you are comfortable with an online-only banking experience. It's a great option for earning some of the best CD rates right now, but you might want to look elsewhere if you're searching for the highest savings rate.\n\nThe First Internet Bank of Indiana Money Market Account has a tiered interest rate system with competitive APYs.\n\nThis account is one of the best money market accounts for large balances. The money market account pays 3.61% APY on account balances of $1 million or under and 4.42% APY on account balances over $1 million. You may also request an ATM card to make ATM withdrawals.\n\nFirst Internet Bank of Indiana is also part of the IntraFi Network, which is a program that offers additional FDIC insurance protection for balances over the $250,000 limit. The way it works is your money is spread across other FDIC-insured financial institutions in the network (there are nearly 3,000 participating banks). Up to $150 million may be FDIC-insured through IntraFi Network Deposits.\n\nThis money market account has a $5 monthly service fee. To waive the fee, you'll need to maintain at least $4,000 in your account. This money market account also doesn't come with check writing privileges.\n\nRate: 3.61% APY on account balances of $1 million or under and 4.42% APY on account balances over $1 million\n\nThe Vio Bank Cornerstone Money Market Savings Account stands out for its low minimum opening deposit and competitive interest rate. To avoid monthly service fees, just make sure to sign up for online bank statements.\n\nThe Vio Bank Cornerstone Money Market Savings Account has a low minimum opening deposit, and no monthly service fees if you sign up for online bank statements.\n\nIf you get paper statements, there's a $5 monthly service fee. The Vio Bank Cornerstone Money Market Savings Account also doesn't include paper checks or a debit card.\n\nThe Brilliant Bank Surge Money Market Account might be a good option if you can keep at least $2,000 in your account so you can waive a $10 monthly service fee. It also stands out as one of the top money market accounts with the highest interest rates.\n\nThe current APY is only available for new depositors. If you live in Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, or Arkansas you won't be eligible to open this account.\n\nCFG Bank has one of the best money market account rates right now, and it pays solid CD rates. These accounts can be opened online from anywhere in the US. It also has a solid online checking account. But to open a standard savings account, you'll need to visit a branch in Maryland.\n\nThe CFG Bank High Yield Money Market Account offers one of the most competitive interest rates on its money market account.\n\nYou'll need $1,000 to open a money market account with CFG and maintain it. Otherwise, you may not earn competitive interest, and have to pay a $10 monthly service fee. This money market account also doesn't come with check writing privileges or a debit card.\n\nEarn up to $500 when you open a new account with code BOOST, deposit a qualifying amount by June 30, 2025, and maintain the amount for at least 90 days.\n\nRaisin is a great option if your ultimate goal is to earn the best savings account, money market account, and CD rates out there. It's a marketplace that connects you with accounts you might not be able to access otherwise, including ones at community-driven and minority-owned institutions.\n\nThe American First Credit Union Money Market Deposit Account offers the highest money market account interest rate on Raisin.\n\nYou may like the American First Credit Union Money Market Deposit Account if you're looking for an option with a high interest rate and low minimum opening deposit. You'll only need $1 to get started.\n\nThrough Raisin, you can use one platform to find, fund, and manage multiple high-yield savings accounts, money market accounts, and CDs from over 20 banks and credit unions.\n\nYou might prefer one of our other top picks if you would rather open a money market account directly with a bank or if you'd like to do all your banking with one financial institution. Raisin doesn't offer checking accounts.\n\nThe Quontic Bank Money Market Account is a good choice if you'd like to open a low-fee money market account — it has zero monthly service fees. This money market account also pays the same interest rate regardless of your account balance.\n\nDepending on your account balance, you may find other financial institutions with more competitive interest rates.\n\nRedneck Bank is a good option if you're looking for a high-yield checking account or money market account with competitive interest rates. The main downside is its tiered rate system, which sees your APY drop if your account goes above a certain balance threshold.\n\nIt's also one of the best banks for a money market account with flexible opening requirements. You only need $500 to get started.\n\nThe interest rate drops if you have more than $100,000, though. If you plan on maintaining a high account balance, you may prefer one of our other top picks to earn the same APY on your entire balance rather than a tiered rate.\n\nThe MYSB Direct Money Market  offers a high APY if you can maintain a $5,000 daily balance. You'll also receive a debit card and checks with this account, and the bank will reimburse any ATM fees you get while using the card.\n\nIf you can't make the $5,000 minimum opening deposit or maintain that balance, you might want to go with another bank. You won't earn any interest if you don't maintain $5,000 as a daily balance, and you'll also have to pay a $10 monthly service fee.\n\nThe Republic Bank of Chicago Digital Money Market Account has the highest interest rate on our list. You might like this account if you're searching for an online money market account that offers paper checks.\n\nThe Republic Bank of Chicago Digital Money Market Account has one of the highest interest rates on our list. You might like this account if you're searching for an online money market account that offers paper checks. This account also might be appealing if you can maintain a minimum of $2,500, so you can waive the $25 monthly service fee.\n\nThis account isn't available in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Michigan. It has a $25 monthly service fee to be mindful of. It also doesn't offer an ATM card or debit card, only paper checks.\n\nTo help you get a better understanding of the overall ethics of a company, we include Better Business Bureau ratings and recent settlement history of the last three years.\n\nThe BBB measures businesses by looking at responses to customer complaints, honesty in advertising, and transparency about business practices.\n\nVio Bank is a division of MidFirst Bank, so we included the BBB rating for MidFirst Bank. Since the American First Credit Union Money Market Deposit Account is available through Raisin, we included Raisin's BBB rating.\n\nBrilliant Bank is an online-only division of Equity Bank. Brilliant Bank hasn't been rated by the BBB yet, but Equity Bank has received a B- grade from the BBB because its failed to respond to two compliants.\n\nRedneck Bank and its parent company, All America Bank, have an NR (No Rating) from the BBB because the bureau doesn't have enough information to rate either company yet.\n\nMYSB Direct doesn't have a BBB page, but its parent bank, M.Y.Safra Bank, does. M.Y.Safra was still given an NR rating from the BBB because the BBB does not have enough information about the business, though.\n\nA strong BBB rating does not guarantee that you'll have a smooth relationship with a company, though. You still may want to ask friends and family about their experiences to see if a bank is right for you.\n\nA money market account is a type of savings account that you can find at many financial institutions. Features can vary by bank, but usually, these accounts offer a tiered interest rate and let you access your account through check-writing privileges or a debit or ATM card.\n\nMoney market accounts let you grow your savings securely and earn interest. The amount of interest you'll earn on a money market account is shown through the annual percentage yield (APY). APY is a percentage, and it tells you how much you'll earn over the course of a year.\n\nGovernment agencies like the FDIC or NCUA protect certain money in bank accounts so that even if there's a bank failure, your money will be protected. Up to $250,000 per depositor, per ownership category is safe in a money market account. This means if you open a money market account by yourself, up to $250,000 is insured. Meanwhile, if you open a joint bank account with someone else, up to $500,000 can be insured in an account.\n\nThese accounts also often offer more accessibility than traditional savings accounts or CDs — many banks offer a debit card or paper checks along with the account. If your money market comes with a debit card or ATM card, make sure you know how big its ATM network is and what fees it charges for out-of-network ATM usage.\n\nAccording to the FDIC, the average money market account pays 0.62% APY. However, the best online banks offer money market accounts with significantly higher interest rates.\n\nSome banks will require you to meet certain criteria to earn interest. You might also see a money market account with tiered interest rates, which means the rate you earn depends on the amount of money you keep in the account.\n\nTo maximize your interest earnings, carefully review the bank's interest requirements to ensure you qualify for the highest rate.\n\nAlso, the compounding frequency for your money market account can affect your total interest earnings if you maintain a high balance. Banks may pay compound interest daily, monthly, quarterly, or annually. APY includes compounding frequency.\n\nA strong money market account won't have any monthly service fees, overdraft fees, or out-of-network ATM fees. Some banks will also reimburse you if you're charged by an out-of-network provider.\n\nBanks specify common bank fees associated with a money market account in a fee schedule. You can find this information online, or you can call customer service to request fee information.\n\nMoney market accounts are FDIC-insured at banks or NCUA-insured at credit unions. In the event of a bank failure, these government agencies will ensure that up to $250,000 per depositor, per account ownership category, is secure.\n\nIf you have more than $250,000 in a money market account, you'll get a Receiver's Certificate from the government agency. This document says you can claim funds once the bank's assets are liquidated. It isn't guaranteed that you'll get uninsured deposits back, though.\n\nWhile our guide highlights the top money market accounts with the highest interest rates, that isn't the only factor you should consider when choosing an account.\n\nIdeally, you want a low-fee money market account so bank fees don't reduce your interest earnings. Review the account's minimum opening deposit, monthly service fees, and interest rate requirements to determine whether a money market account is the best choice for you.\n\nSelecting the right bank can also make a big difference in your overall banking experience. For example, if traditional banking hours don't work for your schedule, then perhaps you'll want a bank with 24/7 customer support. Or, if you want to open other bank accounts, you'll likely value a bank with a variety of account types in lieu of one that has limited services.\n\nSimilar to other types of savings accounts, money market account rates can shift when the Federal Reserve changes the federal funds rate. Money market account rates tend to go up when the Fed raises the federal funds rate, and rates decline if the Fed starts making cuts.\n\nIt's helpful to keep track of Fed meetings so you know when the Federal Reserve may potentially implement changes. There are eight meetings scheduled per year, with the potential for more if needed.\n\nMoney market account rates have declined since they peaked in the 2024, and it's likely they'll decline further throughout 2025.\n\nWhile money market account interest rates are often impacted by changes in economic conditions, banks also have their own criteria for changing rates.\n\nYou can open a money market account online, at a branch, or by phone. Several of our top picks are online-only banks and credit unions. If you choose an online-only financial institution, be aware that you won't have access to any physical locations, so you'll have to set up and manage your account solely online.\n\nWhen you're opening up a money market account, you typically need to have your Social Security number and U.S. ID to fill out the application. That said, the top banks for immigrants and non-U.S. Citizens allow you to provide a foreign passport or Matricula Consular, too.\n\nSeveral of our top picks have a tiered interest rate, so you'll need to meet certain requirements to maximize your savings and get the highest APY. You might need to maintain a certain account balance, set up automatic transfers, or make a specific number of debit card purchases.\n\nIf you don't think you can regularly meet those requirements, you might prefer a money market account that's more straightforward. Some money market accounts pay the same interest rate regardless of how much money you keep or what you do on the account.\n\nIf you have a negative financial history, also know that you still have banking options available. You can look for second chance bank accounts, which are bank accounts that build your banking history.\n\nLike all bank accounts, you'll need to report the interest you earn from your money market account when you file your taxes. Interest is considered a form of income, so you'll need to pay both federal taxes and state taxes on it, depending on where you live and how much interest you make. You can use Form 1099-INT when filling out your tax return to let the IRS know what interest you earned.\n\nWhile bank accounts like money market accounts are one of the safest ways you can make money on your savings, they aren't entirely without risk.\n\nThe biggest risk is that your financial institution might fail or somehow not be able to get you your money, but there are some protections in place to help mitigate that risk. Most banks are FDIC-insured, while most credit unions are NCUA-insured. Fintechs can't be insured by the federal government, but they generally partner with banks to provide FDIC insurance anyway.\n\nBoth of these types of insurance work the same: your money is insured in your bank account up to $250,000 per depositor. That being said, money market accounts are more likely than other bank accounts to require you to keep that much money or more in your account to earn the highest rate. Some of these accounts offer enhanced FDIC insurance by spreading your money across several banks, but not every financial institution does this. If you choose to keep more money than federal insurance covers in your account, keep in mind that you could be opening yourself up to risk if your institution fails.\n\nMoney market accounts are variable-rate accounts, which means that your bank can choose to change your interest rate at any time. This means there's some risk that your bank will lower your interest rate after you've opened an account. You're always free to move your money to another account, but doing that every time there's a rate change can be tiring. If you'd prefer a fixed interest rate, certificates of deposit ensure your rate will stay the same for the CD's term length. For example, if you open a 1-year CD, your interest rate will not change for one year.\n\nIf your money market account has a low interest rate, the interest rate you're earning on your money might be outpaced by the inflation rate, which means your money could actually lose value over time. Right now, you can get a money market account with an interest rate near 4% or 5%, while the general inflation rate is between 2% and 3%. If possible, you'll want to get a money market account that's well over the inflation rate to make sure you're not losing money.\n\nWhile money market accounts are generally easier to withdraw money from than savings accounts, there are still some limits to your liquidity. Many money market accounts charge excess withdrawal fees if you withdraw money more than six times per month. If you think you'll need to regularly make more withdrawals than that, you might prefer a checking account.\n\nThe best high-yield savings accounts pay similar rates to the top money market accounts. The two accounts also share a similar purpose, so figuring out the best fit for you could come down to small preferences in features.\n\nHigh-yield savings accounts often have lower minimum opening deposits than money market accounts. If you do not have that much money to deposit upfront, high-yield savings accounts might be the way to go.\n\nHowever, if you want more account accessibility, money market accounts will be a lot more appealing to you than high-yield savings accounts. High-yield savings accounts do not give out paper checks, and rarely do they offer an ATM or debit card.\n\nDeciding between a money market account and a high-yield checking account will depend on how you plan to use your account. If you usually maintain a high account balance for expenses, a high-yield checking account is a great account option. However, you're better off with a money market account if you want to establish an emergency fund or save for your financial goals.\n\nThese accounts are managed very differently, though. Money market accounts are more accessible. You can deposit or withdraw money at any time. CDs only let you deposit money when you first open the account. You'll have to maintain all your money a CD until it reaches maturity or you'll face an early withdrawal penalty.\n\nInterest earnings can also impact your decision. The best CD rates are slightly higher than money market account rates. CDs also have a fixed interest rate, which means the rate stays the same until maturity. Money market accounts have a variable interest rate, so it can change at any time.\n\nDue to these differences, you might lean more toward a CD if you can set your money aside for a while in order to earn a fixed interest rate. If you need to add or take out money frequently and don't mind rate fluctuations, choose a money market account.\n\nMoney market accounts are often confused with money market funds, but it should be noted that they are very different accounts.  A money market account is a type of bank account. Its protected by federal insurance in the event of a bank failure. A money market mutual fund is an investment option, and it isn't federally insured by the FDIC.\n\nThere's the potential to earn more with a money market fund, but that's also because you're taking some risk — although money market funds are generally considered a low-risk investment, you could still potentially lose money in a money market fund. Meanwhile, money market accounts are protected for up to $250,000 per depositor at banks by the FDIC and at credit unions by the NCUA. You also have a better idea of what your annual rate of return will be with money market accounts than with money market funds, although neither offers a fixed interest rate.\n\nMoney market accounts could be a good choice for money you don't want to lose, such as emergency funds or short-term savings goals. Money market mutual funds are a better choice for long-term savings goals or for money you're not afraid to lose.\n\nThe money market account with the highest interest rate right now is the TotalBank Online Money Market, which pays up to 4.41% APY. Keep in mind rates fluctuate along with the federal funds rate, so banks that offer the highest APY now might not down the road, and ones with lower rates now could hike their rates later.\n\nInterest rates on money market accounts closely follow the federal funds rate. That is to say, rates are variable and can change multiple times per year based on the Federal Reserve's decisions.\n\nNo, money market account rates have been dropping because the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates a few times already. It's forecasted that more rate drops could happen in 2025, which could also impact money market account rates further.\n\nMoney market accounts offer the benefit of paying interest in a safe, low-risk bank account. You'll also typically have more accessibility than other types of savings accounts.\n\nTo learn more about what makes a good money market account and how to choose the best fit, four experts weighed in:\n\nWe're focusing on what will make a money market account most useful, including APY, access to your money, and more. Here's what they had to say about money market accounts. (Some text may be lightly edited for clarity.)\n\n\"A good money market account generally provides several ways to access your money, like a debit card, ATM card, or paper checks.\"\n\n\"I don't really recommend a money market account for parking your money. I don't know if their fees are really that competitive versus high-yield savings accounts. For most people, I think what makes sense is a high-yield savings account for your emergency fund and any short-term goals.\"\n\nHow should someone decide whether to put their money in a money market account or another interest-earning account?\n\n\"So I guess we'll start off with how much money you want to put in and the level of transactions you want to have. If you want to have any transactions, that automatically takes out CDs. Then you're stuck between the high-yield savings and the money market account.\"\n\n\"How soon do you need the money? What kind of access do you need to it? And if you want your money to grow and you want to keep temptation away, then I would put it in a CD.\"\n\n\"I would create a list of what I prioritize most in a bank account. For example, some banks have accounts that charge monthly service fees. I would look to see what the requirements are for waiving the monthly maintenance fee and whether I think I could feasibly meet those requirements each month. If I'm searching for an interest-earning bank account, I'll pay attention to interest rates. I would make sure the account pays a higher interest rate than the average bank account.\"\n\nAt Business Insider, we aim to help smart people make the best decisions with their money. We understand that \"best\" is often subjective, so in addition to highlighting the clear benefits of a financial product or account — a high APY, for example — we outline the limitations, too. We spent hours comparing and contrasting the features and fine print of various products so you don't have to.\n\nOur personal finance team is editorially independent, which means our business team does not decide how we cover products and what we write about. Our editorial standards page has more information about how we review and choose products.\n\nThere are a lot of money market accounts out there. Through our research, we've found that the best money market accounts are offered by banks with a strong online presence and mobile access.\n\nWe reviewed money market accounts using our bank account methodology at nearly 120 institutions to identify the strongest options.\n\nWhile interest rates are an important aspect of any money market account, we also considered minimum deposits and balance requirements, overdraft, and excess transaction fees, the ability to access funds, and any other standout features.\n\nWe score these features on a scale of zero to five and figure out the weighted average to get an account's total rating. The highest total rating a money market account can get is five stars, while the lowest rating is one star.\n\nEditorial Note: Any opinions, analyses, reviews, or recommendations expressed in this article are the author’s alone, and have not been reviewed, approved, or otherwise endorsed by any card issuer.

    "title": "Best Car Shipping Companies Of 2025",
    "content": "Whether you’re looking to ship a car for a long-distance move or bring home a collectible automotive treasure, you’ll want to pick a company you can trust to get your vehicle to its destination safely and affordably. To help you get started, we’ve done deep research on dozens of data points and thousands of consumer opinions to find the best companies to ship your beloved four-wheeled friend.\n\nOur Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI) analysis comprised of over 18,000 consumer insights found that several companies stood out for areas like exceptional service, ease of booking and the ability to pull off complex cross-country car-shipping moves without issues. One of these is our top choice, Easy Auto Ship, which excels in the areas listed above along with several notable pricing perks and policies. However, you can also find several other options worth considering in our list below.\n\nOur team is committed to bringing you independent, unbiased ratings and information. We use proprietary data and expert advice to inform all of our content, including the pros and cons of the top car-shipping companies and tips for choosing the best company for you. Plus, our advisory board of licensed professionals fact-checks and reviews our content for accuracy and relevancy. You can read more about our editorial guidelines for the ratings below.\n\nEasy Auto Ship stands out for its various affordable shipping options. Founded in 2013, the company has expanded to cover all 50 states and ships internationally. While it serves as a broker instead of a carrier, Easy Auto Ship fully vets its partners before allowing them to ship vehicles.\n\nWe picked Easy Auto Ship due partly to its customer-first approach to many of its offerings, like its 30-day pricing guarantee, GPS tracking and free car wash upon delivery.\n\nBesides the perks above, we appreciate that Easy Auto Ship claims to have no hidden fees and provides an extra $100,000 in contingent auto insurance. A $150 cash discount is another bonus worth mentioning. Additionally, it offers free cancellation, price matching and a service guarantee.\n\nEasy Auto Ship requires a $250 deposit, which isn’t ideal. However, it does offer a pretty generous cancellation policy. We’d also like additional features like a 24/7 customer service line and a mobile app.\n\nEasy Auto Ship can be a good option for many customers. It offers both long- and short-distance moving, and open and enclosed shipping. While prices tend to skew a little higher, the value is still there.\n\nEasy Auto Ship experiences tend to be mixed. While some users report satisfying results with prompt service, professional staff and decent prices, others say they have issues with poor communication, unresolved damage claims and a lack of support post-payment.\n\nTo help us get a better idea of pricing, we obtained several quotes covering various cost variables, such as the type of vehicle, the total distance and whether the shipment was open or enclosed. Remember, these are just estimates for a handful of specific scenarios, so it’s important to contact the company to get prices that reflect your situation.\n\nIf you want to save some cash, you should consider AmeriFreight, our top pick for discounts. The 20-year-old company offers discounts for several groups, including first responders, like police, firefighters and medical personnel. There are also discounts for repeat clients, military personnel, older adults, students, early birds and those shipping multiple vehicles.\n\nIn addition to its list of discounts, we chose AmeriFreight for several other reasons, including its competitive pricing and various shipping options.\n\nNot all vehicle shipping companies will transport any vehicle, but AmeriFreight offers services for some of the most diverse vehicles on this list. In addition to standard car and motorcycle shipping, the company offers shipping options for RVs, boats, vans, trucks and antique or classic cars. This variety and its nationwide availability ensure AmeriFreight can handle just about any request.\n\nAmeriFreight lacks some features that other companies on this list provide, including binding quotes, service guarantees and terminal-to-terminal shipping.\n\nIf you have a nontraditional vehicle, consider AmeriFreight, as it offers shipping for just about any type of vehicle. Due to its expansive list of deals, those looking for a discount will also likely find one at AmeriFreight.\n\nIn general, AmeriFreight’s users expressed positive sentiments. In particular, they highlighted staff who were reliable, friendly and professional and maintained great communication. Others mentioned that their vehicles were delivered on time and in good condition, with the process being relatively easy and stress-free. However, some negatives were mentioned, like the initial quotes being lower than the end prices. However, the majority didn’t have a problem with the prices and found them to be reasonable and competitive.\n\nTo help us get a better idea of pricing, we obtained several quotes covering various cost variables, such as the type of vehicle, the total distance and whether the shipment was open or enclosed. Remember, these are just estimates for a handful of specific scenarios, so it’s important to contact the company to get prices that reflect your situation.\n\nWith 25 years in the business, American Auto Shipping ranks in our list of the top car shipping companies for several reasons, including its $0 deposit, competitive pricing and binding quotes, making it one of the best companies in terms of value.\n\nWe picked American Auto Shipping for its strong value among competitors. It offers some of the lowest prices, plus you can expect helpful features like a personal concierge service, an extra $500 insurance reimbursement to help cover deductibles and a free car wash upon delivery.\n\nWe particularly liked American Auto Shipping because it doesn’t require a deposit to secure a shipping date. We also liked its tiered pricing structure, which allows customers to control the overall price by selecting their delivery speed.\n\nWe would like to see American Auto offer a live chat feature, as it’s a good alternative to the phone, especially if you multitask on your computer. Another thing to consider is the lack of international shipping.\n\nAmerican Auto Shipping is best for customers looking to ship their vehicle domestically at a decent price without sacrificing the quality or quantity of services.\n\nUsers often report a positive experience with American Auto Shipping. Highlights include strong customer service and clear communication throughout the process. However, some reviewers did mention concerns about unexpected charges and difficulty reaching customer service.\n\nTo help us get a better idea of pricing, we obtained several quotes covering various cost variables, such as the type of vehicle, the total distance and whether the shipment was open or enclosed. Remember, these are just estimates for a handful of specific scenarios, so it’s important to contact the company to get prices that reflect your situation.\n\nSherpa Auto Transport offers service to 50 states while guaranteeing customers a price lock promise, which states that the quote you receive is what you pay. Additionally, Sherpa puts $300 of its own money on the line if extra funds are needed to complete the service.\n\nWe chose Sherpa primarily for its pricing perks mentioned above; however, other factors helped it rank well, including discounts and no required deposit. It provides service to every U.S. state as well, so a matter of availability is not a concern with Sherpa.\n\nAs mentioned, Sherpa’s price lock promise stood out. However, we also appreciated its stated transparency regarding vetting: It says it looks at accident report histories, maintenance conditions, traffic violations and customer feedback before working with a new carrier.\n\nSherpa lacks a few features that other companies on this list have, such as GPS tracking, expedited shipping and international transport.\n\nSherpa Auto Transport is best for those who value pricing transparency and stability. Its price lock promise guarantees that the company’s competitive quotes will not change due to minor expense shifts.\n\nMost reviewers noted a positive experience with Sherpa Auto Transport. Common themes included smooth booking processes, on-time delivery and outstanding communication. Other users highlighted the company’s transparent pricing and noted no unexpected costs. The few negative reviews mentioned issues with pricing and logistics.\n\nTo help us get a better idea of pricing, we obtained several quotes covering various cost variables, such as the type of vehicle, the total distance and whether the shipment was open or enclosed. Remember, these are just estimates for a handful of specific scenarios, so it’s important to contact the company to get prices that reflect your situation.\n\nMontway Auto Transport has served the vehicle shipping industry for nearly 20 years. In that time, it has established itself as one of the best with a network of more than 30,000 carriers across all 50 states.\n\nSeveral good qualities helped Montway make this list, including competitive pricing, extra insurance coverage and discounts.\n\nMontway Auto Transport offers various services including international transport, motorcycle shipping and military transport. While all its carriers are required to have insurance to join Montway’s network, Montway includes an extra $250,000 of cargo insurance should your claim be denied by the carrier. While claim denials are rare, it’s nice to know Montway has your back.\n\nMontway does not offer price matching, which can be helpful when shopping for quotes. Additionally, a deposit is required to book a service.\n\nWe recommend Montway Auto Transport to consumers searching for a high-value provider with various service offerings. If you are a military personnel, have multiple vehicles to ship or are willing to pay cash, you should also consider Montway as it offers discounts to these groups\n\nMontway Auto Transport generally does well with reviewers who report with on-time delivery, affordable pricing and good communication. Users have noted the professionalism of the drivers and that their vehicles come back in perfect condition and sometimes ahead of schedule. Negative reviews mention some communication issues, problems with pick-up times and unanticipated charges. Overall, Montway is consistent with delivery and customer support.\n\nTo help us get a better idea of pricing, we obtained several quotes covering various cost variables, such as the type of vehicle, the total distance and whether the shipment was open or enclosed. Remember, these are just estimates for a handful of specific scenarios, so it’s important to contact the company to get prices that reflect your situation.\n\nSGT Auto Transport is a relatively new company with only 10 years in the industry. However, in that time, it has grown to be one of the biggest car-shipping brokers with services in all 50 states. Pricing is competitive, whether you choose open or enclosed carrier options.\n\nWe chose SGT Auto Transport as one of our top-ranking car shipping companies partly due to its widespread availability, price-matching policy and service guarantee.\n\nWe like that SGT offers a variety of discounts for students and military personnel. You can also save money by booking your move on a Sunday, something unique to this company. However, it’s worth noting that cash is required to get any of these discounts. Besides discounts, it has 24/7 customer support, something not all shippers offer.\n\nSGT Auto Transport has a $149 cancellation fee and lacks some helpful features like GPS tracking and terminal-to-terminal shipment, which may be necessary for some consumers.\n\nWe recommend SGT Auto Transport for those planning a shorter-distance, door-to-door vehicle transport as the company had the lowest quote for a move of less than 500 miles out of any of the competitors on this list.\n\nMany of SGT Auto Transport’s customers note its professional and efficient service. Users also mention positive interactions with the company’s customer service representatives and delivery team while also noting SGT’s competitive rates. While the majority seem satisfied with SGT’s service, a minority mentioned issues such as delays in pickup and delivery, and concerns with transparency and communication about pricing and carriers.\n\nTo help us get a better idea of pricing, we obtained several quotes covering various cost variables, such as the type of vehicle, the total distance and whether the shipment was open or enclosed. Remember, these are just estimates for a handful of specific scenarios, so it’s important to contact the company to get prices that reflect your situation.\n\nCar shipping can be quite expensive. In fact, according to a recent Forbes Home survey, nearly 30% of people chose to drive their car instead of shipping it specifically to save money. That being said, the cost to ship a car will depend on several factors, including the method of transportation, the type of delivery, the distance of the journey and more.\n\nThe national average cost to ship a car is $1,150, but based on our research, we’ve found that prices can range from as low as $550 to as high as $2,450. That breaks down to 60 cents to $1.70 per mile. Note that per-mile costs may decrease as you get into a longer trip. Because of these and other factors, we recommend reaching out to several companies for customized estimates.\n\nIf you’ve never shipped a car before, you may be feeling a little overwhelmed. To help get you started, here’s a brief overview of how to ship a car from start to finish.\n\nReceive a custom quote from a Car Moving Company today that's designed to meet your needs and budget by clicking on your state.\n\nHere’s a quick breakdown using the factors we discussed above to help you get a better idea of how our top six companies compare.\n\nReceive a custom quote from a Car Moving Company today that's designed to meet your needs and budget.\n\nTo determine the best car-shipping company, the Forbes Home editorial team reviewed 44 major companies, taking into account attributes such as in-house consumer sentiment analysis, pricing, services and features, nationwide availability and more.\n\nYou can find out more about how Forbes Home rates car shipping companies on our detailed methodology page.\n\nCheck to make sure it has a U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) number or a motor carrier (MC) number. You can then look these numbers up in databases like the FMCSA’s SAFER database. If the company doesn’t have a number, it probably isn’t legitimate.\n\nIn some cases, towing can be cheaper, especially if you already own all the needed supplies. However, for most people, we still recommend shipping. Truck and trailer rentals can have many restrictions, and even the most experienced drivers can run into safety issues while hauling a large trailer or dolly.\n\nWhile driving your car will almost always be cheaper, for long-distance moves, we recommend hiring a car shipping company. That way, you won’t put any additional miles on your car or add any wear to it. It’s also easier, more convenient and a lot safer to entrust your vehicle to a professional.\n\nCassidy was an updates editor whose main responsibility is to write and edit articles on a range of home improvement topics.

    "title": "Are Solar Panels Worth It? Here’s How To Tell If They’re Worth It For You",
    "content": "Yes, for the majority of homeowners, solar panels are worth it, especially when facing high and unpredictable electricity bills. Switching to solar may not be worth it if you already pay low electricity bills, you’re renting, or you have to pay a high price for installing solar. It may not be worth it either if you have year-round inclement weather. Getting solar installed depends on your personal situation.\n\nBut on the flipside, converting to solar energy offers many benefits for homeowners, including energy savings, reduced carbon emissions and increased property values. However, switching to solar isn’t right for every house. Our guide will shed a ray of light on everything you need to know about solar energy, from solar panel pros and cons, costs and more, to help you decide if investing in solar is worth it for your home.\n\nSolar power is an eco-friendly renewable energy source plentiful in sunny locations. The technology works by converting sunlight into usable energy in the form of electricity or heat.\n\nSolar technicians install different types of solar panels (typically monocrystalline and polycrystalline) on roofs with photovoltaic (PV) cells that harness and transform sunlight into sustainable energy with the potential to power an entire home––lighting up rooms, running appliances, heating water and keeping everyone warm and cozy on cold days and nights.\n\nSolar panels work when the sun’s rays hit a solar panel, causing the photovoltaic (PV) cells within the installed panel to absorb the sun’s energy. The absorbed energy then ignites electrical charges within the cells that move until they generate an electrical current that we use as electricity.\n\nThe electricity generated from the solar panels moves along a conductive wire to a device called an inverter. The inverter transforms direct current (DC) electricity produced by the solar panels into usable electricity known as alternating current (AC) electricity that we can use for lighting, appliances, and other home systems.\n\nSolar panels are worth it if you already own your property, are dealing with high energy bills and can get solar panels installed that don’t come with a huge price tag. It’s even more worth it when you can take advantage of tax credits, incentives and rebates. Solar can offset your energy costs and translate to big savings down the line and allow you to break even on your investment.\n\nThe national average for solar panels costs about $16,000 for a 5 kilowatt system before tax credits. However, some solar panel systems can run more than $35,000. The exact price a homeowner will pay depends on a number of variables, including geographic location, home size, solar system size and solar installer rates.\n\nIt’s important to remember that the investment for a solar system covers more than just the panel costs.\n\n“Pricing for solar is turnkey, so it includes permits and installation. If you’d like a home battery for resilience when the power goes out, they can add a significant cost to your home solar system price.” – Roger Horowitz, Solar Expert, Advisory Board Member\n\nOn the bright side, solar panel costs have decreased by more than 50% in the last 10 years, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). The typical solar energy system is priced around $16,000, although the actual cost fluctuates depending on a system’s size, regional rates, and the solar installer you choose. The easiest way to find an accurate price is to speak with a local installer.\n\nBy doing some math, we can roughly estimate how much solar panels save the average homeowner. Once you calculate the initial investment for a solar power system and its energy production capacity, you can hypothetically estimate the potential annual savings on your energy bills.\n\nThe lifespan of solar panels is around 25 to 30 years. Homeowners typically recoup their investment in around eight to 12 years. This means after paying off your solar panels, you’ll likely benefit from an average of more than 15 years of savings on utility bills.\n\nHere’s an example: Let’s say you pay the national average of $16,000 for solar panel installation. With the 30% tax credit ($4,800), your average cost will equal $11,200. If you save an average of $100 per month on electricity after the payback period, that’s $1,200 per year. Multiply that by 16 years, and you’ve saved $19,200.\n\n“This doesn’t include SRECs (Solar Renewable Energy Credits) which are only available in some states but can lead to even greater savings.” – Roger Horowitz, Solar Expert, Advisory Board Member\n\nThere are, however, some cases when solar panels don’t yield the return on investment some homeowners expect because of faulty equipment, less-than-optimal sunshine and more. To discover a solar panel system’s expected production rate in your area and potential output issues, you’ll likely need to reach out to a professional. Ask people you know for recommendations to find the best solar companies in your area. You can also find customer reviews of solar companies on the Better Business Bureau website and review sites online.\n\nBefore investing in going green, it’s important to know the advantages and disadvantages of solar panel installation to help you decide if solar is a worthwhile investment for your home. Consider the following pros and cons that provide some insight.\n\nEvery kilowatt-hour (kWh) of solar generated by your panels can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions such as CO2, and toxic pollutants like sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, according to the Department of Energy.\n\nWhile installing solar panels may require an initial investment, homeowners will experience savings in the long term. That also means reduced electricity bills and no more surprise high bills to deal with.\n\nMany states have net metering programs that allow you to profit from unused energy. That means homeowners get credits for the electricity they add to the grid from their panels.\n\nCustomers will receive a 30% federal tax credit just for adding solar panels to their homes. While every state is different, homeowners can save even more money with local state incentives and rebates.\n\nDepending on the state that you live in or the company you go with you may have a high initial upfront cost. Incentives and rebates can help with costs but not all states offer those.\n\nIf you happen to live in an area that gets severe cold weather you may not be getting the full benefits from your solar panels.\n\nInstallation can be expensive, depending on the company you go with, and whether you have a strong warranty. And while panels do not require too much maintenance, any issues with your panels requiring repairs or maintenance could be costly.\n\nMost solar installation companies provide you with different financing options, however, not all financing options, such as leasing, allow you to take advantage of incentives and rebates.\n\nFind a network of trusted installers for your solar system, solar panels and electricity needs. Find a solar panel installer today!\n\nHouseholds that reap the greatest rewards from solar panels are those located in states with higher electricity rates. For example, if you live in Connecticut, Massachusetts or California where electricity is more expensive, you’ll benefit more from a solar system than a household would in Oregon, North Carolina and Louisiana with lower electricity rates.\n\nInvesting in solar panels can bring numerous benefits to your home. However, there are specific circumstances when installing solar panels is particularly advantageous. For instance, sudden high electricity bills or living in a region with abundant sunlight are two key factors that can significantly affect the value and necessity of installing solar panels.\n\nAs a homeowner, noticing a change in your electricity bills is undoubtedly alarming, especially when they’re higher. So, if you consistently notice an increase in energy costs every month, investing in a solar panel system can offer a long-term money-saving solution. By producing clean and renewable energy from sunlight, solar panels enable you to decrease your home’s reliance on the traditional energy grid, reducing your electricity bills over time. This transition to solar energy can offer financial relief in the long run despite the high upfront cost of installing a solar panel system.\n\nInstalling a solar panel system is even more beneficial when living in a location with abundant sunlight. States with many sunny days throughout the year, such as California, Arizona and Texas, offer ideal conditions for maximizing the efficiency and output of solar panels. The ample sunlight exposure in these areas allows solar panels to generate more electricity so that homeowners can capitalize on the benefits of renewable energy, such as lower energy costs, increased property value and an eco-friendlier lifestyle.\n\nIn many cases, solar panels can increase your home’s value. While they require substantial upfront costs, solar panels can increase your home’s value by about 4%, according to Zillow. Some research has also shown that homes that have solar panels tend to sell faster than those without them.\n\nTo understand if solar panels are worth it for your home, it’s vital to consider the following factors.\n\nIf you desire to adopt a greener lifestyle to help the planet and live in a climate with ample sun exposure, installing solar panels on your home can do double duty by helping the environment and earning you money by selling the surplus of energy back to the grid.\n\nWhile the costs of solar panel installation have decreased over the last decade, maintenance can still be a significant expense for some homeowners. To find out if you’re a good candidate for solar energy, here’s how to find the best solar installers near you.\n\nTo arrive at the average prices in this article, we surveyed four industry websites on national and local levels. All averaged figures were correct at the time of publication and may be subject to change.\n\nFind a network of trusted installers for solar system, solar panels and electricity needs. Find a solar panel installer today!\n\nYou can save money with solar panels, depending on where you live. Your solar exposure and the cost of electricity where you are will determine just how much value you’ll get from a system.\n\nGetting solar panels is like adding anything else large and immovable to your home, namely that you’ll have to take care of it for the long term. You’ll need to periodically clean and maintain your solar system to keep it working at peak performance, as well as continue to pay a bill over the longer term if you finance it.\n\nThe payback period for a solar panel system is going to be determined by how much you ultimately pay for the system after rebates and incentives, the cost of your system, the cost of electricity from your local utility company and the cost of ongoing maintenance. In general, though, you can expect a solar panel system to pay for itself in six to 10 years.\n\nIt depends on where you live whether or not a house with solar panels is harder to sell. In some areas, they’re considered extremely desirable upgrades, if you own the system or will own the system, versus leasing it. Consult a local real estate agent for more information on how your market feels about solar panels.\n\nStacy is a journalist and content creator with six years of experience writing about home improvement topics.

    "content": "You might be using an unsupported or outdated browser. To get the best possible experience please use the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge to view this website.\n\nStarting a business is easy. Over a recent five-year span, there were an average of 4.7 million businesses started each year in the U.S.\n\nOn the other hand, starting and growing a successful business is anything but easy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimates that one in five businesses fail in their first year, nearly half within five years and close to two-thirds before they reach 10 years.\n\nSucceeding as a business owner takes more than smarts, hard work and a great idea. A successful business focuses from day one on establishing and maintaining profitability. There are many ways to define a “successful business,” but making significantly more money than you’re spending on a consistent basis tops most people’s list. No matter how you get there, or how long it takes, your business’s financial success is the result of keeping a steady focus on the bottom line.\n\nUnless you’re one of those rare unicorns whose ultimate goal is to sell their bright idea to a megacorp, your new business will need to generate more revenue than it spends relatively quickly and consistently. Achieving your ultimate business objective has six stages: planning, securing funding, registering, launching, establishing and creating value.\n\nIf you know you want to be in business for yourself but don’t know where to start, Forbes contributor Melissa Houston identifies five types of business that are expected to be in demand in 2025. The list includes healthcare for seniors, products and services that promote sustainability, artificial intelligence (AI) consulting, digital marketing agencies, and products and services for pets. One thing all five have in common is their potential to generate profits quickly and consistently.\n\nOnce you’ve decided on the type of business you’d like to start, you’re ready to begin your research. The SBA offers an omnibus Business Guide that covers planning, launching, managing and growing a business. The guide includes links to SBA funding programs, federal contracting, the SBA Learning Platform for finding training and skills development programs, and a directory of local services for new businesses that you can search by ZIP code.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs has created a Veteran Entrepreneur Portal to promote the use of small and disadvantaged businesses. The portal features video tips for starting a business, potential sources for funding and federal contracting opportunities available to veterans.\n\nYou don’t have to begin your journey with an official business plan in hand, but you’ll likely need a formal document describing your business at some point, especially if you plan to apply for a business loan or want to attract investors.\n\nStart by finding out more about the businesses you’ll be competing with than they know about themselves. The first thing you want to study is how they manage to turn a profit: Do they get a break on their overheads or other operating expenses somewhere down the line? How much business does their advertising and other marketing investments pull in? Where are their customers coming from, and what’s the best way for you to reach these people?\n\nThis way, you can spot the things they’re doing that work and the areas where you can outdo them. Think about the ways your product or service tops theirs, and the best ways to capitalize on your advantages. Take plenty of time to cogitate on the specifics of your business, who you’ll need to hire, upfront costs and all required permits, licenses and certifications.\n\nArguably the most effective way to start your pre-launch research is by talking to someone with experience in your chosen field and knowledge of your vicinity (for local businesses). The Small Business Administration (SBA) recommends studying six aspects of your market:\n\nAfter completing the first phase of your ongoing market research, you’re ready to decide on a business structure. The most common types are sole proprietorship, general partnership, limited liability company (LLC), limited liability partnership (LLP), C-corporation and S-corporation:\n\nOnce you’ve determined what your business will sell and have devised a strategy for reaching your potential customers, it’s time to create your organization’s road map for success: your business plan. The plan’s three purposes are to describe the focus of the business, explain how it will be funded and designate who you’ll hire to manage and operate the entity.\n\nThe SBA provides three free business plan templates: two that take a traditional approach, and one that uses a “lean startup format.”\n\nYour marketing efforts begin well before your first day of operation. In addition to creating your website, you have to optimize it for search engines so that it appears in search results when people enter keywords and phrases related to your products. You’ll also want to add your business to online directories and establish a presence on social media.\n\nWith your business plan in hand, you can begin the search for funding by determining how much money you’ll need to start and run your business, which includes the amount you’re able to self-fund with your own money or that of close investors (family and friends). Being able to fund the business yourself gives you full control over its operation, while relying on outside investors usually requires ceding some ownership and operational responsibility.\n\nFunding options include small business loans, crowdfunding and the SBA’s Lender Match program that works with more than 800 lenders located throughout the United States for both SBA-approved loans and conventional business loans. Our guide to the Best Startup Business Loans recommends considering five factors when comparing startup business loans:\n\nOne of the first orders of business for your new company is to select a name that’s unique, descriptive and easy to remember. Make sure the internet domain that matches your chosen name is available, and confirm its uniqueness with your state’s business-name-search tool or a third-party service such as BusinessNameSearch.org.\n\nBusiness types other than sole proprietorships and partnerships must register with the state’s official business liaison, which is usually the Secretary of State office. A registered agent service is necessary for LLCs and corporations  in all states as the point of contact for official correspondences with state agencies.\n\nRegistered agents are required to have a physical address that’s accessible during business hours to accept tax and legal documents on behalf of the business. You can serve as your own registered agent if you’re available during standard office hours and take full responsibility for complying with all state requirements.\n\nThe business will also need an employer identification number (EIN) from the IRS, as well as various licenses and permits from local, state and federal entities. The specific ones your business will need depend on your industry and jurisdiction.\n\nMost businesses will also need to recruit and hire the workers who will power the operation. Finding the right pace of hiring can be a challenge for a new business. Overhiring can be avoided by establishing and sticking to a hiring budget. This also ensures that you have sufficient time and resources for onboarding new hires and monitoring their workloads to prevent overburdening them.\n\nTo realize these milestones, your business has to navigate around potential disruptions to your production and marketing plans such as errors in financial projections, problems with supply or ineffective marketing, to name just a few.\n\nThe day that cookie entrepreneur Debbi Fields opened the first Mrs. Fields cookie store in Palo Alto in the late 1970s, she bet her husband that she could break $50 in sales before closing time. Hours passed with no customers arriving. To avoid losing the bet, Fields took to the streets, handing out free samples. She sold $75 worth and happily collected from her husband.\n\nFields knew right away that if something’s not working, try something else. She also was laser focused on getting immediate feedback, calculating how much she needed to bring in each hour to be profitable (she estimated it was about $32—those were the days!) Her willingness to adapt and commitment to reaching and maintaining profitability helped her build an empire.\n\nA new business may struggle to get the attention of its target market, secure adequate funding or recruit qualified employees. These are some responses to common startup glitches.\n\nYour business’s first-year accomplishments are merely the prelude to the challenges and triumphs you’ll encounter as you guide the enterprise into its mature stage. You’ve begun to establish your all-important customer base, found and trained your all-important staff and are generating sufficient revenue to invest some profits back into your operation. It’s time to rework your business’s financial plan to ensure the funds needed to power your growth will be available.\n\nAs a startup, your goal was to achieve profitability and consistent revenue generation. However, this is no time to simply stay the course, no matter how well you think the business is doing. The transition from startup to established entity requires reassessing your goals, marketing strategy and approach to financing.\n\nBuild on what you have learned about your customers and what they like and dislike about your products to adjust your marketing strategy and plan enhancements to your product lineup. What your customers want and need changes over time, so capitalizing on these changes requires that you get ahead of them by constantly analyzing the features they prize and those they shun.\n\nYou’ve created a community around your business that you can tap through direct contact and social media. Let your customers know that you value their feedback and are attuned to their needs. Expand your online presence and take every opportunity to listen to and respond to the insights your customers and potential customers share with you.\n\nThe best way to grow your business  is by finding new sources for generating leads that you can convert into sales. Customer relationship management (CRM) systems collect and analyze information about your current and potential clients from online sources and your direct interaction with the public. The goal is to build awareness of your brand while you identify the most promising leads and learn the demographics of your target audience.\n\nThe expectations of your workers change as the company transitions from startup to an established business.\n\nListening to employees and responding to their needs doesn’t happen once or twice a year but regularly through thoughtful interactions in the workplace and during extracurricular activities. Make them aware of the opportunities for growth and promotion available to them, and support their willingness to take risks and try new things, which makes them more engaged and effective.\n\nJust as you created a business plan as part of your startup preparations, you’ll need a profit plan as the company transitions to its established phase. The plan should cover five areas of analysis:\n\nOnce your business has successfully passed from startup to established, it’s time to think about your exit strategy, even if you have no immediate plans to move on. The ultimate goal you had in mind when you first imagined starting the business has likely been adjusted, as industries, markets and the economy in general evolve. Regardless of your departure plan, the mature phase of the business is when you maximize its value prior to cashing out.\n\nThe components of a value-enhancing strategy are a strong brand, diversified revenue streams, intellectual property, operational efficiency and financial management.\n\nSometimes the fastest way to succeed in business is by not starting from scratch. But before you start shopping for an existing business to take over, think about the reasons the current owner is selling. It could be that they simply have achieved the goal they set when they started out. However, it could also be because the person expects a downturn or other circumstance that threatens the business’s profitability.\n\nSources for buying businesses include online business marketplaces, business brokers, industry trade associations and classified ads. Note that the IRS allows you to deduct up to $5,000 of the cost of the business in the first year if you spend less than $50,000 in total, but the deduction disappears if you spend more than $55,000.\n\nStarting a business is relatively easy but establishing and maintaining its growth and profitability requires ongoing planning, research and risk taking. There are plenty of resources available to point you in the right direction, many of which we’ve listed here. Plus, to make it easier, we’ve laid out a step-by-step guide to help you prepare, launch and grow your own business.\n\nIn his decades-long career in tech journalism, Dennis has written about nearly every type of hardware and software.

    "content": "This was CNBC’s live coverage on April 7, 2025 of how the White House, U.S. trade partners and employers responded to President Donald Trump’s historic tariffs.\n\nCNBC’s reporters covered the tariffs and their effects, live on air and online from our bureaus in Washington; London; Singapore; San Francisco; and Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.\n\nHome Depot co-founder Ken Langone is blasting Trump’s tariffs, calling the 46% import duties on Vietnam “bullshit” and describing the 34% tariff rate on China as “too aggressive, too soon.”\n\n“I don’t understand the goddamn formula,” the veteran Republican political campaign donor says in a new interview with The Financial Times.\n\n“I believe [Trump’s] been poorly advised by his advisers about this trade situation — and the formula they’re applying,” he adds.\n\nBessent has been surprised by the “impatience” in the stock market since the tariff announcement, he told Fox Business. He sees the sweeping new import duties as the starting point for a negotiation which could last several months.\n\n“Maybe almost 70” countries have reached out to the White House about negotiating tariffs, Bessent said on Fox Business, including Japan, whose Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba spoke to Trump on Monday.\n\nBessent expects Japan to “get priority” in negotiations in exchange for having come to the table quickly.\n\nElon Musk’s younger brother harshly criticized Trump’s tariffs, calling them a “structural, permanent tax on the American consumer.”\n\nKimbal Musk, who is a Tesla board member, also said in a tweet that Trump appears to be the “most high tax American President in generations.”\n\n“Even if he is successful in bringing jobs on shore through the tariff tax, prices will remain high and the tax on consumption will remain the form of higher prices because we are simply not as good at making things,” Kimbal Musk wrote.\n\nTesla, in a recent letter to the U.S. Trade Representative, warned of the potential effect on its bottom line of retaliatory tariffs from countries affected by Trump’s tariffs.\n\nElon Musk is the CEO of Tesla, as well as the de facto head of DOGE, the Trump administration’s project to slash federal spending.\n\nApple shares continued to get hammered, losing 3.7% as concerns mounted that the company would take a major hit from President Trump’s tariffs.\n\nMonday’s selloff brings Apple’s three-day rout to 19%, a downdraft that’s wiped out $638 billion in market cap.\n\nAnalysts say that Apple is one of the most exposed companies to a trade war, partially due to its reliance on China for manufacturing its computers and accessories. Although Apple has production in India, Vietnam, and Thailand, those countries also face increased tariffs as part of Trump’s sweeping plan.\n\nAnalysts say Apple will likely either need to raise prices or eat additional tariff costs when the new duties come into effect. UBS analysts estimated on Monday that Apple’s highest-end iPhone could rise in price by about $350, or around 30%, from its current price of $1,199.\n\nTrump is rejecting the European Union’s offer of “zero-for-zero” tariffs with the U.S. for industrial goods.\n\n“No, it’s not,” Trump said in the Oval Office when asked if the deal, which European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen floated earlier Monday, was enough.\n\n“They’re screwing us on trade,” Trump said, criticizing the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO.\n\nTwo Republican senators, Mike Lee of Utah and Wisconsin’s Ron Johnson, have encouraged Trump to take von der Leyen’s deal.\n\nA warning against retaliation tops a list of five steps countries can take to reduce the burden on the United States from the dollar being the world’s reserve currency, the head of the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers said.\n\nCEA Chair Stephen Miran, speaking at a Hudson Institute event, said that the U.S. dollar and Treasury securities “make possible the global trading and financial system which has supported the greatest era of prosperity mankind has ever known.”\n\n“The best outcome is one in which America continues to create global peace and prosperity and remain the reserve provider, and other countries not only participate in reaping the benefits, but they also participate in bearing the costs,” he said.\n\nIsrael Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country will “eliminate the trade deficit with the United States.”\n\n“We’re going to also eliminate trade barriers, a variety of trade barriers, that have been put up unnecessarily,” Netanyahu said in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump last week announced a 17% tariff on Israel, even after the Middle East ally said it would scrap its own tariffs on U.S. goods.\n\nThe White House is prepared to hold “meaningful negotiations” in the coming weeks with some of the more than 50 countries that have responded “positively” to Trump’s tariffs, Bessent says in an X post.\n\nThe treasury secretary draws a contrast between these countries and China, which he claims has “chosen to isolate itself by retaliating and doubling down on previous negative behavior.”\n\nU.S. oil prices fell about 2% on Monday, adding to last week’s steep losses on fears President Donald Trump’s global tariffs would push the U.S., and maybe the world, into a recession.\n\nU.S .crude oil fell $1.29, or 2.08%, to close at $60.70 per barrel, while Brent lost $1.37, or 2.09%, to settle at $64.21. The latest price action comes after U.S. crude and Brent closed down more than 10% last week.\n\nFutures tied to U.S. West Texas intermediate crude hit a session low of $58.95 per barrel, the lowest level since 2021. Global benchmark Brent fell to an intraday low of $62.51.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will negotiate with Japan on Trump’s tariffs, Bessent says in a new X post.\n\n“Japan remains among America’s closest allies, and I look forward to our upcoming productive engagement regarding tariffs, non-tariff trade barriers, currency issues, and government subsidies,” Bessent writes.\n\nPrices of cars and trucks are expected to rise as a result of Trump’s tariffs, according to a new analysis from industry experts at Cox Automotive.\n\nThe firm expects the already implemented 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and upcoming 25% levies on auto parts will add thousands of dollars to the costs of imported and domestic vehicles.\n\n“We expect to see declining discounting and then accelerated price increases as the tariffs are passed through and supply tightens, leading to price increases on all types of most new vehicles,” Cox Automotive Chief Economist Jonathan Smoke said. “Over the longer term, we expect production sales to fall, newly used prices to increase, and some models to be eliminated.”\n\nWhile the tariffs do not directly impact used car sales, changes in new vehicle prices, production and demand affect the used car market, which is how the majority of Americans purchase a vehicle.\n\nA meeting between Trump and Netanyahu at 2 p.m. will proceed as planned, the White House said. Reporters will be admitted into the Oval Office for that event.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink says that most other chief executives he speaks with “would say we are probably in a recession right now.”\n\n“One CEO specifically said the airline industry is a proverbial bird in a coal mine — canary in the coal mine — and I was told that the canary is sick already,” Fink said during an event at the Economic Club of New York.\n\nTrump plans to veto a bipartisan bill that would give Congress a say on his tariffs if it lands on his desk.\n\nThe White House’s Office of Management and Budget, in a statement, said it strongly opposes the bill because it would “severely constrain” Trump’s power to “respond to national emergencies and foreign threats.”\n\nThe legislation, dubbed the Trade Review Act of 2025, would empower Congress to either approve Trump’s new tariffs or let them expire. Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., sponsored the bill.\n\nTrump previously vowed to veto a different bill that would effectively undo the tariffs he imposed on Canadian imports. The Senate approved that bill with the help of four Republican votes.\n\nTrump ordered the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japan’s Nippon Steel to undergo a new review after the deal was blocked by President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump directed the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to review the acquisition again to assist “in determining whether further action in this matter may be appropriate,” according to a presidential action issued by the White House.\n\nRestaurant stocks fell in afternoon trading as investors worry that the Trump tariffs will weigh on consumer spending.\n\nShares of Starbucks fell more than 3%, following a downgrade to neutral from Baird, citing near-term economic headwinds. The coffee chain, which is already attempting to turn around its U.S. business, has seen its shares sink nearly 20% since Trump unveiled the new tariffs.\n\n“Explanations for the drawdown we heard included higher coffee costs from tariffs, anti-American sentiment, and recession risk,” Bank of America Securities analyst Sara Senatore wrote in a research note on Saturday.\n\nU.S. airlines are expected to cut their outlooks for the year when they report earnings starting this week, analysts say.\n\nThe industry is seeing cracks in demand for travel. And airline stocks have fallen as investor concerns have grown about Trump’s tariff policies, among other things.\n\n“The level of sell-off is worse than the reality right now, but it doesn’t necessarily mean it won’t be the reality six months from now,” Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said.\n\nTD Cowen, in a note Friday wrote, “We expect a world of slower growth, higher inflation, and a more isolationist U.S. to significantly disrupt the competitive environment for airlines.”\n\n“We are concerned that the new economic paradigm causes another structural leg down in corporate travel while the negative wealth effect further dampens consumption, especially by Baby Boomers,” TD Cowen said.\n\nA large majority of CEOs surveyed by CNBC — 69% — said they expect a recession on the heels of Trump’s sweeping, market-rupturing tariff plans announced last week.\n\nWhite House trade advisor Peter Navarro said that countries would have to do more than just reduce their tariffs on U.S. imports to zero for the Trump administration to back off its trade policy.\n\n“Let’s take Vietnam. When they come to us and say ‘we’ll go to zero tariffs,’ that means nothing to us because it’s the nontariff cheating that matters,” Navarro said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”\n\nThose nontariff policies include a value-added tax and the routing of Chinese products through Vietnam, Navarro said.\n\nTrump said in a Truth Social post on Friday that To Lam, general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, had offered to cut tariffs on U.S. products to zero. Later in the interview, Navarro described that offer as a “small first start.”\n\nApple shares have tumbled more than 5%, Tesla shares are down about 4% and Microsoft shares have slipped more than 1%. Shares of Google are mostly flat, but Amazon, Nvidia and Meta are all up around 1%.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks collectively shed more than $1.8 trillion in market value during a two-day market selloff last week. The Nasdaq Composite recorded its worst week since the onset of the pandemic and entered a bear market.\n\nTrump is not concerned about the optics of him golfing over the weekend as stock markets fall on his tariff strategy, a White House official told NBC News.\n\nTrump’s golf rounds in Florida are like “going to a birthday party after a friend has had surgery,” the official said.\n\nTrump is threatening to jack up tariffs on China by an additional 50% unless Beijing abandons its retaliatory duties on U.S. imports.\n\nTrump in a Truth Social post gave China until Tuesday to undo its 34% tariffs, imposed in response to the “reciprocal” duties unveiled at the White House last week.\n\nTrump also wrote that he will cancel all planned talks with China if they do not comply with his demand.\n\nChina’s action came “despite my warning” that any country retaliating against the new U.S. tariffs “will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs, over and above those initially set,” Trump wrote.\n\n“Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”\n\nTwo Republican senators urged Trump to accept an offer by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for zero percent tariffs on industrial goods imported from the U.S. in exchange for the same rate on imports from the EU.\n\n“Let’s take that deal,” Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said in a tweet replying to a video of von der Leyen’s offer. “Much to gain.”\n\nCorrection: Ursula von der Leyen is president of the European Commission. An earlier version misstated her title.\n\nU.S. tariffs on China will total 104% if Trump’s latest threat takes effect, a White House official confirmed to CNBC’s Megan Cassella.\n\nTrump announced blanket 34% tariffs on Beijing last week, which come on top of existing 20% duties on Chinese imports.\n\nTrump’s latest tariff action would slap an additional 50% tariff on Chinese goods, unless China drops its 34% retaliatory tariff on the U.S.\n\nBillionaire Richard Branson is warning that the U.S. “will face ruin for years to come” if the Trump administration does not immediately “change course” on its tariff policies.\n\n“The US government can still turn things around, but it must act in the next few hours,” the Virgin Group co-founder wrote on X.\n\n“This is the moment to own up to a colossal mistake and change course. Otherwise, America will face ruin for years to come,” he wrote.\n\nThe White House dismissed a wire headline that said Trump is considering pausing new tariffs for 90 days.\n\n“Fake news,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNBC’s Eamon Javers after a headline that cited Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council.\n\nTrump himself posted on social media a video of Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo saying, “Rates are plummeting, oil prices are plummeting, deregulation is happening.”\n\nTrump writes that it’s “not sustainable” for the U.S. to “lose $1.9 trillion on trade” in a post just now on Truth Social.\n\nTrump’s post includes a video of him talking to reporters, in which he also says that the U.S. can’t lose money on trade “and also spend a lot of money on NATO in order to protect European nations.”\n\nTesla shares are trading around 20% lower than they were when Lutnick urged people to “Buy Tesla” last month.\n\nLutnick touted Tesla, whose CEO is the Trump administration DOGE chief Elon Musk, in a March 19 interview on Fox News.\n\n“It’s unbelievable that this guy’s stock is so cheap,” Lutnick said. “It’ll never be this cheap again.”\n\nCanada filed a dispute with the the World Trade Organization concerning Trump’s 25% tariffs on automobiles and automobile parts imported from Canada into the U.S.\n\nCanada requested WTO dispute consultations with the U.S. concerning the new levies, the global trade organization said. The WTO says the request for consultations formally initiates a dispute in the organization.\n\nConsultations will give the parties an opportunity to discuss the matter without proceeding further with litigation. After 60 days, if consultations have failed to resolve the dispute, the complainant may request adjudication by a panel, according to the WTO.\n\nCanada claims the measures are inconsistent with the U.S.′ obligations under various provisions of the “General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade” of 1994.\n\nPeople who voted for Trump are more likely to own stock than those who voted for Kamala Harris in November’s election — and they also tend to have more money tied up in the market.\n\nCNBC’s All-American Economic Survey in December found that 51% of Trump voters have stock market investments, compared to 46% of Harris voters.\n\nAnd of those Trump voters, 53% had investments worth more than $50,000, while just 45% of Harris voters had that much money tied up in stock.\n\nTop White House trade advisor Peter Navarro is shrugging off Elon Musk’s swipe at his qualifications, while suggesting there is daylight between the Tesla CEO’s trade views and those of the Trump administration.\n\nNavarro told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that he has not spoken to Musk since he tweeted that Navarro “ain’t built s---.”\n\nBut Musk kept up another post that said “a PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing,” a shot at Navarro’s alma mater.\n\n“I’ll probably see him today in the Oval. It’s no big deal,” Navarro told CNBC when asked about Musk’s comments.\n\n“When it comes to tariffs and trade,” Navarro said, Musk “is a car manufacturer — but he’s not a car manufacturer, he’s a car assembler.”\n\n“What we want, and the difference in our thinking and Elon’s on this, is that we want the tires made in Akron, we want the transmissions made in Indianapolis,” he said.\n\n“Countries from all over the World are talking to us,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, and “tough but fair parameters are being set.”\n\nTrump spoke to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba earlier in the day, and “he is sending a top team to negotiate.”\n\n“They have treated the U.S. very poorly on Trade. They don’t take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs,” Trump says in the post, adding, “it all has to change, but especially with CHINA!!!”\n\nEurope will establish a new import surveillance task force, as it looks to diversify its trade portfolio in the wake of Trump’s sweeping tariffs.\n\n“Further diversifying our trade relations is very critical for us, because this broadens the market opportunities and is crucial for our companies,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at a press briefing.\n\n“So we will focus like a laser beam on the 83% of global trade that is beyond the United States, vast opportunities, and this is why we’re deepening our relations with our trading partners.”\n\nVon der Leyen mentioned existing deals with Mexico and Switzerland, and potential deals with India, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.\n\nEurope stands ready to respond to Trump’s aggressive tariff agenda with counter measures if necessary, she said, but the region still stands “ready to negotiate” with the U.S. if possible.\n\nTop White House trade advisor Peter Navarro is pushing back on concerns that Trump’s plan to restore U.S. manufacturing through tariffs will take years to bear fruit, if it works at all.\n\n“Investment can made in auto parts factories that are still there, and it won’t take long,” Navarro said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”\n\nHe then pointed to the first Trump administration securing protective equipment faster than expected at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n“So don’t tell me that America doesn’t have the wherewithal to move things and we can do stuff,” he said.\n\nA CNBC flash survey of CEOs contacted in the wake of Trump’s sweeping tariff rollout last week was far less optimistic: 45% of respondents said that any reshoring would take minimum two years, and more likely three years or more.\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon says Trump’s tariffs will likely boost prices on both domestic and imported goods, weighing down a U.S. economy that had already been slowing.\n\n“Whatever you think of the legitimate reasons for the newly announced tariffs – and, of course, there are some – or the long-term effect, good or bad, there are likely to be important short-term effects,” Dimon writes.\n\n“We are likely to see inflationary outcomes, not only on imported goods but on domestic prices, as input costs rise and demand increases on domestic products.”\n\n“Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,” he adds.\n\nDimon is the first CEO of a major Wall Street bank to publicly address Trump’s sweeping tariff policy as global markets crash.\n\nHis remarks appear to backtrack from earlier comments he made in January, when Dimon said that people should “get over” tariff concerns because they were good for national security. At the time, tariff levels being discussed were far lower than what was unveiled last week.\n\nElon Musk posted a video on X of Milton Friedman advocating for free trade, in one of the strongest examples yet of the billionaire SpaceX founder’s break with Trump on tariffs.\n\nHe also said said he hopes Europe and the U.S. can move “to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone,” during a virtual appearance at a meeting of Italy’s far-right League party.\n\nMusk’s comments were at odds with Trump’s hostility towards the European Union, which Trump has targeted with a 20% tariff on exports.\n\nMusk is Trump’s biggest campaign donor and the leader of DOGE, Trump’s massive effort to slash the federal workforce.\n\nTrump recently told Cabinet members that Musk would be leaving his post at DOGE in the coming months.\n\nAckman is apologizing for accusing Lutnick of being “indifferent” to a stock market crash because he stands to profit from it.\n\n“I don’t think he is pursuing his self interest. I am sure he is doing the best he can for the country while representing the President as Commerce Secretary. It is not an easy job and we don’t know how the sausage was made.”\n\nThe new post comes nine hours after Ackman slung the accusation at Lutnick and his investment banking firm, Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\n“I just figured out why @howardlutnick is indifferent to the stock market and the economy crashing. He and Cantor are long bonds. He profits when our economy implodes,” Ackman wrote Sunday night.\n\n“It’s a bad idea to pick a Secretary of Commerce whose firm is levered long fixed income. It’s an irreconcilable conflict of interest.”\n\nTrump is touting the steep drop in oil prices — driven by fears of reduced demand in the increasingly likely event of a recession — as a policy win.\n\n“Oil prices are down, interest rates are down (the slow moving Fed should cut rates!), food prices are down, there is NO INFLATION, and the long time abused USA is bringing in Billions of Dollars a week from the abusing countries on Tariffs that are already in place,” Trump writes in his latest Truth Social post.\n\n“This is despite the fact that the biggest abuser of them all, China, whose markets are crashing, just raised its Tariffs by 34%, on top of its long term ridiculously high Tariffs (Plus!), not acknowledging my warning for abusing countries not to retaliate,” he writes. “They’ve made enough, for decades, taking advantage of the Good OL’ USA!”\n\n11:00 a.m. ET: Trump will host the World Series-winning Los Angeles Dodgers at the White House, according to his official schedule.\n\n2:30 p.m. ET: Netanyahu, one of Trump’s closest allies, will participate in a joint press conference with the president at the White House.\n\nThe last time Netanyahu visited the White House was in February, as the U.S. worked to finalize the second phase of a cease fire deal in Gaza. It did not hold, however, and Israeli forces have since resumed ground operations in Gaza.\n\nCNBC’s latest CEO survey finds that a majority of the CEOs polled say they now expect a recession before the end of the year. Of those, around half say that a recession, if it happens, will likely be moderate.\n\nOne in three of the CEOs say they expect that their companies will be forced to cut jobs in 2025 due to Trump’s tariff policies.\n\nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes.\n      Global Business and Financial News, Stock Quotes, and Market Data\n      and Analysis.\n\nTo provide you with a more relevant online experience, certain online ad partners may combine personal information that we make available with data across different businesses and otherwise assist us with related advertising activities, as described in ourPrivacy Policy.

    "title": "Creative head Donatella Versace to step down at Versace amid Prada takeover speculation",
    "content": "Donatella Versace will end nearly 30 years as creative director of fashion label Versace, handing the reins of the flashy luxury brand to Miu Miu’s Dario Vitale, the brand’s owner said Thursday.\n\nThe shuffling comes amid reports that larger Italian rival Prada — which owns Miu Miu — is in talks to buy Versace, which was co-founded by Donatella Versace’s brother, Gianni, in 1978.\n\nThe development brings to an end the family control over the creative direction of Versace, a brand beloved by jet-setters and the famous for its showy, skin-baring looks and Medusa logo.\n\nDonatella Versace, 69, will become the label’s chief brand ambassador beginning April 1, the same day Vitale takes over, owner Capri Holdings Limited said in a statement.\n\n“It has been the greatest honour of my life to carry on my brother Gianni’s legacy. He was the true genius, but I hope I have some of his spirit and tenacity,” Versace said, adding that she will remain “Versace’s most passionate supporter”.\n\nVitale has led the design direction of Miu Miu — Prada’s sister brand which targets a younger clientele — since 2023, helping to boost the group’s bottom line in a challenging environment for luxury fashion.\n\nMiu Miu’s retail growth soared 93 percent last year.\n\nVersace boasts “a unique heritage that has spanned decades and has shaped the history of fashion”, said Vitale, who is not well-known outside the industry.\n\nFashion group Capri Holdings, which also owns Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors, has owned Versace since 2018.\n\nPrada is reportedly in advanced talks to acquire Versace, with Bloomberg reporting earlier this month a potential price of nearly 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion).\n\nPrada executives have not publicly commented on the discussions with Versace, with Chairman Patrizio Bertelli saying earlier this month he was “very cautious” over any possible acquisitions.\n\nOne of the industry’s most recognisable figures, with her platinum blonde hair and penchant for high heels, Versace spent much of her early life as the self-styled muse to her older brother Gianni, who was murdered in 1997 by a serial killer.\n\nHis death thrust the youngest Versace sibling to the helm of the family fashion empire, which she began to lead as its new chief designer at age 42 with no formal fashion training.\n\nSome of Versace’s most well-known looks — including Jennifer Lopez’s cut-to-there filmy green gown worn to the 2000 Grammy’s — were due to the younger Versace’s vision and ability to attract celebrities to the brand.\n\nAs a brand ambassador, Versace will now focus on the company’s philanthropic and charity work.\n\nAfter a period of sales slumps and restructuring, Capri brought the company for 1.83 billion euros in 2018.\n\nVersace’s portfolio now includes hotels and homeware along with fashion and accessories. It owns 230 boutiques around the world and has more than 400 licensed stores.\n\nIndustry observers had also speculated that Vitale could have gone to lead the creative design at Gucci, which let go of Sabato de Sarno in February after just two years on the job.",

    "title": "Amazon has paused some data center lease commitments, Wells Fargo says",
    "content": "Amazon has delayed some commitments around new data center leases, Wells Fargo analysts said Monday, the latest sign that economic concerns may be affecting tech companies’ spending plans.\n\nA week ago, a Microsoft executive said the software company was slowing down or temporarily holding off on advancing early build-outs. Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft are the leading providers of cloud infrastructure, and both have ramped up their capital expenditures in recent quarters to meet the demands of the generative artificial intelligence boom.\n\n“Over the weekend, we heard from several industry sources that AWS has paused a portion of its leasing discussions on the colocation side (particularly international ones),” Wells Fargo analysts wrote in a note. They added that “the positioning is similar to what we’ve heard recently from MSFT,” in that both companies are reeling in some new projects but not canceling signed deals.\n\nTech stocks have been under pressure across the board his year as President Donald Trump’s proposals for widespread tariffs raised the prospect for dramatically higher costs on imports of equipment while also threatening to slow the economy. Cloud infrastructure providers have been aggressively announcing plans to collectively spend hundreds of billions of dollars securing Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, and building new data centers.\n\nThat was before the announcement on tariffs earlier this month. Microsoft and Amazon both report quarterly results next week. Their stock prices were down on Monday, bringing Amazon’s decline for the year to 25% and Microsoft’s drop to 15%.\n\nEarlier this month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin that he did not see the company cutting down on data center construction.\n\n“This is routine capacity management, and there haven’t been any recent fundamental changes in our expansion plans,” Kevin Miller, AWS’ vice president of global data centers, wrote in a LinkedIn post.\n\nWATCH: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy letter to shareholders: Generative AI will reinvent every customer experience\n\nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes.\n      Global Business and Financial News, Stock Quotes, and Market Data\n      and Analysis.\n\nTo provide you with a more relevant online experience, certain online ad partners may combine personal information that we make available with data across different businesses and otherwise assist us with related advertising activities, as described in ourPrivacy Policy.

    "title": "State of Freight",
    "content": "A glitch in the system regarding the code to exempt all freight that was on the water this week and should be exempt from any new tariffs put into place by the Trump administration, including freight already on the way from China and any nations now under a 90-day reprieve, has now been fixed.The glitch lasted for more than 10 hours, according to the latest alert provided by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nThe alert explained that U.S. Customs had deployed an “immediate correction to the issue reported earlier today” in which the Automated Commercial Environment did not accept the lower duty rate of 10% for entries that properly qualify as in-transit shipments filed since April 9.\n\nCustoms said with this update, “articles the product of countries that have an additional country-specific rate of duty that were (1) loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading and in transit on the final mode of transport on or after 12:01 a.m. EDT April 5, 2025, and before 12:01 a.m. EDT April 9, 2025, and (2) are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, before 12:01 a.m. EDT on May 27 2025, should claim the 10% additional rate in lieu of the country-specific rate of duty.”\n\nCBP also added that users will “need to resubmit the applicable entry summaries in the Automated Commercial Environment that qualify for the in transit provision as soon as possible and within ten days of the date of release.”\n\nCBP also said it “will continue to ensure all tariff revenue due to the United States is collected and will provide additional guidance to the trade community through CSMS messages as appropriate.”\n\nCustoms issued an update at 8:19 a.m. that they were aware the entry code for U.S. shippers to use to have their freight exempted was not working and “the issue is being reviewed.”\n\nIn the alert, Customs advised filers “to transmit cargo release separately and follow up with the summary filing when resolved.”\n\nNormally, when a U.S. importer pays for their freight, they file both the cargo release forms and their financial papers, so they can pay for their cargo. To keep the cargo moving, Customs is advising importers to file the cargo release form now, and file the financial form later, once the glitch is corrected.\n\nThe tariffs being paused on many nation’s trade, and the Chinese tariffs still in effect, are based on the sailing date, or the date the freight leaves the factory or warehouse. This is called an “on the water” clause and is in effect for all freight bound to the U.S. that has been on the water before the April 5, 9, and 10 tariff announcements.\n\nThe “on the water” clause has not changed, even though the China tariff percentages have increased to 145% and a series of other recent tariffs have been put in place.\n\nFor U.S. shippers and the supply chain, it’s the latest blow at a time of uncertainty and fear about tariffs policy. It also raises questions about Customs’ ability to handle the new policy and collect the tariffs revenue that is key to the Trump administration’s economic goals.\n\nInterpretations of the multiple executive orders, social media posts, and customs alerts have some U.S. companies and industry groups trying to figure out when the new tariffs will be deployed.\n\n“There has been some confusion on what President Trump has said in social media posts on when the tariff starts and what is written in the executive order,” said Jarred Varanelli, vice president of U.S. sales at logistics firm Savino Del Bene. “Social media posts are not law on the pause and increase in tariffs. With the constant changes to the regulations, all customs brokers in our industry have a difficult task ahead of them.”\n\nDespite President Donald Trump saying numerous times tariffs are in effect and being collected, U.S. shippers told CNBC they have not been charged higher tariff rates on their containers, some of which came in as late as Thursday.\n\nDewardric McNeal, managing director and senior policy analyst at Longview Global with a focus on international trade, foreign affairs and defense, told CNBC glitches do happen, but the timing is unfortunate and will lead to more questions about Customs’ ability to keep up with the pace of the tariffs.\n\n“Whether you agree or disagree with the policy, you have to ask, do we have the ability to do it this rapidly?” said McNeal. “This glitch may be an indication we need more time. It seems odd this is the time it happens. This adds policy chaos for the implementer.”\n\nTo keep the freight moving, Customs is telling firms to pay the duties and tariffs within ten days of the cargo’s release to Customs.\n\n“It’s a mess, to simply state it,” said McNeal. “I don’t think it will slow down goods. But it will increase the paperwork for the U.S. companies who are suffering tariff whiplash. These companies will need to refile that at a later date. Trade will flow but at greater complexity.”\n\nThe CPB said in a statement to CNBC that since April 5, it has collected over $500 million under the new tariffs, and $21 billion in total tariff revenue under new trade actions implemented since Jan 20, 2025.\n\nThe U.S. is currently at work on negotiations with over 75 countries on tariffs deals that Trump has said will be tailored to each nation.\n\nRick Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, a three-generation educational toy company which makes its products in China, said this year it was scheduled to expand with the construction of a new building, but now he is pausing expansion and reviewing his company’s financials to see where cuts can be made.\n\n“I cannot run my business based on social media posts,” said Woldenberg. “This is making it difficult for me to make my business decisions. Instead of planning on growth, I’m talking about surviving. This trade policy can kill me and hundreds of small businesses like me. This will eliminate jobs. The banking industry and insurance industry that serve businesses both large and small will be impacted if companies go bankrupt.”\n\nWoldenberg expects massive disruption. “The interconnectedness of all of this is not well understood. This policy was crafted with little interest in the details. It’s these details that will drive business and the economy down the toilet.”\n\nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes.\n      Global Business and Financial News, Stock Quotes, and Market Data\n      and Analysis.\n\nTo provide you with a more relevant online experience, certain online ad partners may combine personal information that we make available with data across different businesses and otherwise assist us with related advertising activities, as described in ourPrivacy Policy.
