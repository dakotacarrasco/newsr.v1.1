By supporting cutting-edge technologies like carbon capture and storage, nuclear energy, and next-generation geothermal, the Trump Administration is ensuring America leads in both energy production and environmental innovation -- producing the cleanest energy in the world. Moreover, by ending the Biden-era pause on liquefied natural gas export approvals, the U.S. is sharing cleaner energy with allies, reducing global emissions, and creating American jobs -- building on President Trump's first-term successes, where the U.S. led the world in greenhouse gas emission reductions.\n\nPresident Trump is championing sound forest management. The Trump Administration's proactive forest management policies protect America's forests, reduce catastrophic wildfires, and promote sustainable land use. By streamlining regulations and expanding responsible logging, President Trump is safeguarding millions of acres of forestland, improving wildlife habitats, and supporting rural economies at the same time.\n\nPresident Trump is ending the forced use of paper straws. Not only are paper straw mandates flawed in their alleged scientific backing, they're also bad for humans and the environment. According to a new report , paper straws contain dangerous PFAS chemicals -- \"forever chemicals\" linked to significant long-term health conditions -- that infiltrate the water supply. Moreover, studies have found producing paper straws can have a larger carbon footprint and require more water than plastic straws for \"approximately zero environmental impact.\"\n\nPresident Trump is cutting wasteful regulations that stifle innovation and raise costs. Actions like pausing restrictive emissions rules for coal plants and revising the National Environmental Policy Act implementation have accelerated responsible energy and infrastructure projects while maintaining rigorous environmental standards -- saving American families thousands annually on energy bills and proving that a strong economy and a healthy environment go hand-in-hand.\n\nPresident Trump is protecting public lands. The Trump Administration has prioritized access to federal lands for energy development while ensuring responsible management. By opening more federal lands and waters for oil, gas, and critical mineral extraction , the U.S. is strengthening energy security and reducing reliance on foreign resources. Simultaneously, investments in conservation, such as $38 billion in clean water infrastructure during President Trump's first term, continue to safeguard America's natural heritage for future generations.\n\nPresident Trump is pushing back on unfair trade practices that harm the environment and undercut U.S. producers and exporters. For years, foreign countries have taken advantage of our generosity at the expense of American workers and the environment. Deforestation in Brazil is at a 15-year high , China's unfair, harmful fishing practices flood the global market with illegal fish and deplete stocks, and Mexico fails to deter illegal fishing -- all while enjoying massive trade deficits with the U.S. and contributing to global environmental degradation.\n\nPresident Trump is cracking down on China -- the most prolific polluter in the world. According to Reuters , China is \"responsible for the most ocean plastic pollution per year with an estimated 2.4 million tons, about 30 percent of the global total.\" By imposing tough trade measures and promoting American manufacturing, the Administration is reducing reliance on China's high-pollution industries, ensuring the U.S. leads by example with cleaner production and responsible global stewardship.\n\nPresident Trump is protecting wildlife. By pausing certain wind projects, President Trump is recognizing wind turbines' detrimental environmental impact, particularly on wildlife, which often outweighs their benefits.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE\n\nOffice of the Vice President\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nFor Immediate Release April 22, 2025\n\nREMARKS BY VICE PRESIDENT VANCE\n\nON THE U.S. AND INDIA'S SHARED ECONOMIC PRIORITIES\n\nRajasthan International Center\n\nJaipur, India\n\n3:17 P.M. IST\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Hello. Good to see everybody. How we doing?\n\nAUDIENCE: Good.\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Good. Good.\n\nWell, it's an amazing privilege to be here in Jaipur. I'm thrilled to address the Ananta Centre's India-U.S. Forum, and I'm thrilled to have you all here with me. Thanks to all of you, the business leaders, decision-makers, and, of course, the students for being here. And thanks to our great team at the U.S. embassy for everything that you guys do for our country.\n\nIn the United States, we're proud of the deep connection between our nations -- between India and the United States. Prime Minister Modi, as most of you probably know, was one of the first visitors welcomed into the Oval Office during President Trump's second term. And like President Trump, the prime minister inspires remarkable loyalty because of the strength of his belief in his people and in his country.\n\nNow, we're so grateful for Prime Minister Modi's hospitality, as well as the reception that he and everyone else in this country have given us on this first trip for me to India. This is my first time visiting the birthplace of my wife's parents, and she's, of course, in the front row there. There you are, Usha.\n\nYou -- she's a bit of a celebrity, it turns out, in India. I think more so than her husband. But I haven't been here long, but already I've been fortunate enough to visit the Akshardham Temple -- did I pronounce that right, honey? -- I did okay? -- all right -- with my family this morning, as a matter of fact. And last night, Prime Minister Modi welcomed me, Usha, and our three small children at his beautiful home.\n\nI've been amazed by the ancient beauty of the architecture of India, by the richness of India's history and traditions, but also by India's laser-like focus on the future. And those things, I think -- this appreciation for history and tradition, and this focus on the future -- is very much something that I think animates this country in 2025.\n\nNow, in other countries I visited, it sometimes feels like there's a flatness, a sameness, a desire to just be like everyone else in the world. But it's different here. There's a vitality to India, a sense of infinite possibility, of new homes to be built, new skylines to be raised, and lives to be enriched. And there's a pride in being Indian, a feeling of excitement about the days that lie ahead.\n\nNow, it's a striking contrast with too many in the West, where some in our leadership class seem stricken by self-doubt and even fear of the future. To them, humanity is always one bad decision away from catastrophe. The world will soon end, they tell us, because we're burning too much fuel or making too many things or having too many children. And so, rather than invest in the future, they too often retreat from it.\n\nSome of them pass laws that force their nations to use less power. They cancel nuclear and other energy generation facilities, even as their choices -- the choices of these leaders -- lead to more dependence on foreign adversaries. Meanwhile, their message to their friends, to countries like India, is to tell them that they are not allowed to grow.\n\nWell, President Trump rejects these failed ideas. He wants America to grow. He wants India to grow, and he wants to build the future with our partners all over the globe.\n\nAnd when I look at this audience or when I visit this incredible country over these last couple of days, I see a people that will not be held back.\n\nNow, the most profound responsibility I believe that all of us have is not to ourselves but to the next generation, to make sure we leave them with a better society than the one that our parents and our grandparents gave us. And this is the world that America seeks to create with you.\n\nWe want to build a bright new world, one that's constantly innovating, one that's helping people to form families, making it easier to build, invest, and trade together in pursuit of common goals.\n\nNow, I believe that our nations have much to offer one another, and that's why we come to you as partners looking to strengthen our relationship.\n\nNow, we're not here to preach that you do things any one particular way. Too often, in the past, Washington approached Prime Minister Modi with an attitude of preachiness or even one of condescension. Prior administrations saw India as a source of low-cost labor on the one hand, even as they criticized the prime minister's government -- arguably the most popular in the democratic world. And as I told Prime Minister Modi last night, he's got approval ratings that would make me jealous.\n\nBut it wasn't just India. This attitude captured too much of our economic relationship with the rest of the world, so we shipped countless jobs overseas and, with them, our capacity to make things -- from furniture, appliances, and even weapons of war. We traded hard power for soft power, because with economic integration, we were told, would also come peace through sameness. Over time, we'd all assume the same sort of bland, secular, universal values no matter where you lived. The world was flat after all. That was the thesis, and that was what they told us.\n\nAnd when that thesis proved false or at least incomplete, leaders in the West took it upon themselves to flatten it by any means necessary. But many people across the world -- and I think your country counts among them -- they did not want to be flattened. Many were proud of where they came from: their way of life, the kind of jobs they worked, and the kind of jobs their parents worked before them. And that very much includes people in my own country, the United States of America.\n\nNow, some of you are aware of my own background. I actually didn't plan to talk about my background at all until last night at dinner, while my children mostly behaved -- we gave them A-minus for behavior with the prime minister -- the prime minister said, \"I have one request. I want you to talk a little bit about your background.\" And so, I wanted to do that -- for those of you who don't know anything about me, I wanted to talk about it.\n\nI come from -- and I'm biased -- the greatest state in the Union, the state of Ohio: a longtime manufacturing powerhouse in the United States of America. My home, specifically, is a place called Middletown. Now, it's not a massive city by any means -- it's not Jaipur -- but it's a decent-sized town and a place where people make things, which has been a point of pride in Middletown for generations.\n\nIt's filled with families like my own, some of whom called us \"hillbillies\" -- Americans who came down from the surrounding hills and mountains of West Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky to cities like Middletown in pursuit of the manufacturing jobs that were creating widespread prosperity for families all across America. They came to Middletown in search of what we call back home \"the American dream.\"\n\nIn Middletown, my parents raised me, my grandparents raised me. They taught us to work hard. They taught me to study hard, and they taught me to love God and my country and always be good to your own.\n\nMy granddad, who I called \"Papaw\" growing up, he typified that. Late into life, he worked as a steelmaker at the local mill, and I know India has a lot of those. Papaw's job gave him a good wage, stable hours, and a generous pension. All that allowed him to support not just him and my grandmother but his own daughter and grandkids with him. Now, by the time I came around, money was awfully tight, but he worked hard to make a good living for all of us.\n\nNow, I know Papaw and Mamaw were grateful for the way of life their country made possible. Their generation bore witness to the formation of America's great middle class, and by creating an economy centered around production, around workers who build things, and around the value of their labor, our nation's leaders then transformed their country and made thousands of little Middletowns possible.\n\nThe government supported its labor force. We created incentives for productive industries to take root and struck good deals with international partners to sell the goods made in the United States of America.\n\nBut as America settled in to world historic prosperity it generated, our leaders began to take that very prosperity and what created it for granted. They forgot the importance of building, of supporting productive industry, of striking fair deals, and of supporting our workers and their families.\n\nAnd as time went on, we saw the consequences. In my hometown, factories left, jobs evaporated. America's Middletowns ceased to be the lifeblood of our nation's economy. And the United States -- as it became transformed, those very people -- the working class, the background of the United States of America -- were dismissed as backwards for holding on to the values their people had held dear for generations.\n\nNow, Middletown's story is my story, but it's hardly unusual in the United States of America. There are tens of millions of Americans who, over the last 20 or so years, have woken up to what's happening in our nation. But I believe they woke up well before it's too late.\n\nNow, like you, we want to appreciate our history, our culture, our religion. We want to do commerce and strike good deals with our friends. We want to found our vision of the future upon the proud recognition of our heritage, rather than self-loathing and fear.\n\nI work for a president who has long understood all of this. Whether through fighting those who seek to erase American history or in support of fairer trade deals abroad, he has been consistent on these issues for decades. And as a result, under the Trump Administration, America now has a government that has learned from the mistakes of the past.\n\nIt's why President Trump cares so deeply about protecting the manufacturing economy that is the lifeblood of American prosperity and making sure America's workers have opportunities for good jobs.\n\nAs we saw earlier this month, he will go to extraordinary lengths to protect and expand those opportunities for all Americans.\n\nAnd so, today, I come here with a simple message: Our administration seeks trade partners on the basis of fairness and of shared national interests.\n\nWe want to build relationships with our foreign partners who respect their workers, who don't suppress their wages to boost exports but respect the value of their labor.\n\nWe want partners that are committed to working with America to build things, not just allowing themselves to become a conduit for transshipping others goods.\n\nAnd finally, we want to partner with people and countries who recognize the historic nature of the moment we're in, of the need to come together and build something truly new -- a system of global trade that is balanced, one that is open, and one that is stable and fair.\n\nNow, I want to be clear: America's partners need not look exactly like America, nor must our governments do everything exactly the same way, but we should have some common goals. And I believe, here in India, we do in both o- -- economics and in national security.\n\nAnd that's why we're so excited. That's why I'm so excited to be here today. In India, America has a friend, and we seek to strengthen the warm bonds our great nations already share.\n\nNow, critics have attacked my president, President Trump, for starting a trade war in an effort to bring back the jobs of the past, but nothing could be further from the truth. He seeks to rebalance global trade so that America, with friends like India, can build a future worth having for all of our people together.\n\nAnd when President Trump and Prime Minister Modi announced in February that our countries aim to more than double our bilateral trade to $500 billion by the end of the decade, I know that both of them meant it, and I'm encouraged by everything our nations are doing to get us there.\n\nAs many of you are aware, both of our governments are hard at work on a trade agreement built on shared priorities, like creating new jobs, building durable supply chains, and achieving prosperity for our workers.\n\nIn our meeting yesterday, Prime Minister Modi and I made very good progress on all of those points, and we are especially excited to formally announce that America and India have officially finalized the terms of reference for the trade negotiation. I think this is a vital step. Thank you. I believe this is a vital step toward realizing President Trump's and Prime Minister Modi's vision because it sets a roadmap toward a final deal between our nations.\n\nI believe there is much that America and India can accomplish together. And on that note, I want to talk about a few areas of collaboration today, how India and the United States can work together: first, perhaps most importantly, to protect our nations; second, to build great things; and finally, to innovate the cutting-edge technologies both our countries will need in the years to come.\n\nNow, on defense, our countries already enjoy a close relationship -- one of the closest relationships in the world. America does more military exercises with India than we do with any other nation on Earth.\n\nThe U.S.-India COMPACT that President Trump and Prime Minister Modi announced in February will lay the foundation for even closer collaboration between our countries. From Javelins to Stryker combat vehicles, our nations will coproduce many of the munitions and equipment that we'll need to deter foreign aggressors -- not because we seek war, but because we seek peace, and we believe the best path to peace is through mutual strength. And the -- launching the joint Autonomous Systems Industry Alliance will enable America and India to develop the most state-of-the-art maritime systems needed for victory.\n\nIt's fitting that India, this year, is hosting the Quad Leaders' Summit this fall. Our interests in a free, open, peaceful, and prosperous Indo-Pacific are in full alignment. Both of us know that the region must remain safe from any hostile powers that seek to dominate it.\n\nGrowing relations between our countries over the last decade are part of what led America to designate India a Major Defense Partner -- the first of that class. This designation means that India now shares, with the UAE, a defense and technology infrastructure and partnership with the United States on par with America's closest allies and friends.\n\nBut we actually feel that Indir- -- India has much more to gain from its continued defense partnership with the United States, and let me sketch that out a little bit.\n\nWe, of course, want to collaborate more. We want to work together more. And we want your nation to buy more of our military equipment, which, of course, we believe is the best in class.\n\nAmerican fifth-generation F-35 s, for example, would give the Indian Air Force the ability to defend your air space and protect your people like never before. And I've met a lot of great people from the Indian Air Force just in the last couple of days.\n\nIndia, like America, wants to build, and that will mean that we have to produce more energy. That's more energy production and more energy consumption. And it's one of the many reasons why I think our nations have so much to gain by strengthening our energy ties.\n\nAs President Trump is fond of saying, America has once again begun to \"drill, baby drill.\" And we think that will inure to the benefit of Americans but it will also benefit India as well.\n\nPast administrations in the United States of America, I -- I think [DEL: motifated :DEL] [motivated] by a fear of the future, have tied our hands and restricted American investments in oil and natural gas production. This administration recognizes that cheap, dependable energy en- -- is an essential part of making things and is an essential part of economic independence for both of our nations.\n\nOf course, America is blessed with vast natural resources and an unusual capacity to generate energy, so much that we want to be able to sell it to our friends, like India. Well, we believe your nation will benefit from American energy exports and expanding those exports. You'll be able to build more, make more, and grow more, but at much lower energy costs.\n\nWe also want to help India explore its own considerable natural resources, including its offshore natural gas reserves and critical mineral supplies. We have the capacity and we have the desire to help. Moreover, we think energy coproduction will help beat unfair competitors in other foreign markets.\n\nBut India, we believe, can go a long way to enhance energy ties between our nations. And one suggestion I have is maybe consider dropping some of the nontariff barriers for American access to the Indian market.\n\nNow, I've talked about this, of course, with Prime Minister Modi. And, look, President Trump and I know that Prime Minister Modi is a tough negotiator. He drives a hard bargain. It's one of the reasons why we respect him.\n\nAnd -- and we don't blame Prime Minister Modi for fighting for India's industry, but we do blame American leaders of the past for failing to do the same for our workers, and we believe that we can fix that to the mutual benefit of both the United States and India.\n\nLet me give an example. American ethanol, we believe, made from the finest corn in the world, can play a tremendous role in enhancing our partnership. And I know our farmers would be delighted to support India's energy security ambitions.\n\nWe welcome the Modi government's budget announcement to amend India's civil nuclear liability laws, which currently prevent U.S. producers from exporting small modular reactors and building larger U.S.-designed reactors in India.\n\nThere's much that we can create, much that we can do together.\n\nWe believe that American energy can help realize India's nuclear power production goals -- and this is very important -- as well as its AI ambitions. Because, as the United States knows well and I know that India knows well, there is no AI future without energy security and energy dominance.\n\nAnd that brings me to my final point of collaboration. I believe that the technological collaboration between our countries is going to extend well beyond defense and energy.\n\nThe U.S.-India TRUST initiative that President Trump and Prime Minister Modi have launched will be a cornerstone of the partnership in the future. It'll build on billions of dollars of planned investments that American companies have already announced across India.\n\nIn the years to come, we're going to see data centers, pharmaceuticals, undersea cables, and countless other critical goods being developed and being built because of the American and Indian economic partnership.\n\nAnd I'll say it again, I think that our nations have so much to gain by investing in one another: America investing in India and, of course, India investing in the United States of America.\n\nAnd I know that Americans, our people are excited about that prospect and that President Trump and I are looking forward to stronger ties.\n\nAmericans want further access to Indian markets. This is a great place to do business, and we want to give our people more access to this country. And Indians, we believe, will thrive from greater commerce from the United States. This is very much a win-win partnership and certainly will be far into the future.\n\nAnd as I know this audience knows better than most, neither Americans nor Indians are alone in looking to scale up their manufacturing capacity. The competition extends well beyond cheap consumer goods and into munitions, energy infrastructure, and all sorts of other cutting-edge technologies. I believe that if our nations fail to keep pace, the consequences for the Indo-Pacific, but really the consequences for the entire world, will be quite dire.\n\nAnd this, again, is where India and the United States have so much to offer one another. We've got great hardware -- the leading artificial intelligence hardware in the world. You have one of the most exciting start-up technology infrastructures anywhere in the world.\n\nThere's a lot to be gained by working together, and this is why President Trump and I both welcome India's leadership in a number of diplomatic organizations, but, of course, in the Quad.\n\nWe believe a stronger India means greater economic prosperity but also greater stability across the Indo-Pacific, which is, of course, a shared goal for all of us in this room and is a shared goal for both of our countries.\n\nI want to close with -- with one last story, or maybe a couple of stories. So, you know, my -- my son Ewan is seven years old. He's our firstborn son. And yesterday, after we -- we had dinner at the prime minister's house, the food was so good and the prime minister was so kind to our three children that Ewan came up to me afterwards, and he said, \"Dad, you know, I think maybe I could live in India.\"\n\nAnd -- but I think after about 90 minutes in the Jaipur sun today at the great palace -- -- he suggested that maybe we should move to England. So, you take the -- the good with the bad here.\n\nBut I -- I want to talk about Prime Minister Modi because I think he's a special person. I first met Prime Minister Modi at the AI Action Summit in February, and we had a lot of important discussions on AI and other policies to prepare for.\n\nThe prime minister also managed to figure out that my son Vivek was actually turning five years old on the trip. This was in Paris just a couple of months ago.\n\nSo, think about this. Amid a huge international policy conference, he took the time to stop by where I was staying; wish our second son, Vivek, a happy birthday; and even bring him a gift. Usha and I were both genuinely touched by his graciousness, and we have been even more impressed by his warmth since we arrived in India.\n\nNow, it's interesting. Some of you may know that when you're a politician, your kids spend almost as much time in the limelight as you do. And the -- the great things about kids is they are brutally honest. They're brutally honest with everybody, whether you want them to be or not.\n\nAnd our seven-year-old, our five-year-old, and then our -- our three-year-old baby girl, Mirabel -- it's interesting. They have only really been -- they've only really attached themselves to; they've only really liked, I should say; they've only really built a rapport with -- with two world leaders.\n\nThe fors- -- first, of course, is President Trump. He just has a certain energy about them -- about him. But Prime Minister Modi, it's the exact same thing. Our kids just like him. And I think that because kids are such good [DEL: strong :DEL] [judge] of characters, I just like Prime Minister Modi too, and I think it's a great foundation for the future of our relationship.\n\nI could tell then -- I could tell when Prime Minister Modi came over a couple of months ago and I believe today that he is a serious leader who has thought deeply about India's future prosperity and security, not just for the rest of his time in office but over the next century.\n\nAnd I want to end by making a simple overarching point. We are now officially one quarter into the 21 st century -- 25 years in, 75 years to go. And I really believe that the future of the 21 st century is going to be determined by the strength of the United States-India partnership. I believe -- -- thank you.\n\nI believe that if India and the United States work together successfully, we are going to see a 21 st century that is prosperous and peaceful. But I also believe that if we fail to work together successfully, the 21 st century could be a very dark time for all of humanity.\n\nSo, I want to say, it's -- it's clear to me, as it is to most observers, that President Trump, of course, intends to rebalance America's economic relationship with the rest of the world. That's going to cause -- fundamentally will cause profound changes within our borders in the United States, but, of course, with other countries as well.\n\nBut I believe that this rebalancing is going to produce great benefits for American workers, it's going to produce great benefits for the people of India, and because our partnership is so important to the future of the world, I believe President Trump's efforts, joined, of course, by the whole country of India and Prime Minister Modi, will make the 21 st century the best century in human history. Let's do it together.\n\nGod bless you. And thank you for having me.\n\nEND 3:42 P.M.

    "content": "OPINION — In a country bitterly divided on virtually everything, from the major to the mundane, there’s one issue that could unite Republicans and Democrats: age limits.\n\nAn uncomfortable conversation about the acuity of aging politicians, from Republicans Strom Thurmond of South Carolina and Thad Cochran of Mississippi to Democrats Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia and Dianne Feinstein of California, has only been magnified by former President Joe Biden’s years in office and former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s closing time on Capitol Hill. Then there’s former Texas Rep. Kay Granger, now 82, who was discovered by The Dallas Express staying at an assisted living facility toward the end of her House term as she dealt  with what was later reported as “dementia issues.”\n\nSan Francisco Democrats made news recently over a proposed resolution to call politicians in California to voluntarily retire at an age to be determined later. But the country and Congress should consider something more permanent, specific and restrictive.\n\nOne of the first criticisms of any suggestion about age limits on elected officials is usually discrimination — the idea that you can’t discriminate against candidates based on their age. But the Constitution already does so, with age minimums.\n\nMembers of the House have to be 25 years old, (Article 1, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution). Members of the Senate have to be 30 years old (Article 1, Section 3, Clause 3). And presidents have to be 35 years old (Article 2, Section 1, Clause 5). So the age discrimination argument shouldn’t even be a part of the conversation.\n\nConsidering the general bias toward the perceived wisdom of the Founding Fathers, a critic could say that the framers who included an age minimum would have included age maximums if they had wanted. But life expectancies were considerably different more than 200 years ago.\n\nThe average life expectancy was closer to 40 years in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. And even though the first six presidents served into their mid-to-late 60s, the Founding Fathers couldn’t have fathomed elected officials serving into their 80s and 90s. At 81, Benjamin Franklin was 15 years older than any other signer of the Constitution. Today, he wouldn’t rank among the top 10 oldest members of Congress.\n\nAt a time when Congress can barely agree on a framework for when to reach an agreement, passing a constitutional amendment seems particularly ambitious. A constitutional amendment must first be approved by a two-thirds vote of both chambers of Congress and ratified by three-fourths of the states with an up-or-down vote in each legislative chamber.\n\nThere’s been only one constitutional amendment passed in the past 50 years. The 27th Amendment, first submitted in 1789, was ratified in 1992 and effectively said that any raise Congress votes to give itself can’t take effect until after the next election so constituents can decide whether they deserve it. (The 26th Amendment, which lowered the voting age to 18 years, passed in 1971.)\n\nThere could be some initial pushback from Republicans because age limits might be seen as a shot at the current 78-year-old resident of the White House and his ability to do the job. And there’s the challenge of asking current members of Congress to limit their own tenures in Congress. So there might have to be some sort of provision to grandfather in (or, in some cases, to great-grandfather in) sitting lawmakers to exempt them from the new restrictions.\n\nThat would leave us waiting a long time for the fruits of such an effort to be seen. But that doesn’t mean it’s not a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nWhile longtime incumbents often rouse strong feelings of loyalty and deference, it’s hard to imagine that lawmakers who work beside elderly colleagues believe it’s in the best interest of their constituents and the country for them to serve into their golden years.\n\nA considerable majority of Americans are open to this idea. More specifically, 82 percent of Republicans and 76 percent of Democrats support a maximum age limit for elected officials, according to a 2023 Pew Research Center poll.\n\nBut landing on a specific maximum age might be more difficult than the daunting task of passing a constitutional amendment: 85 years old? 80?\n\nFor some reference points, senators in Canada, who are appointed and not elected, have a mandatory retirement age of 75. In the Catholic Church, only cardinals younger than 80 can participate in a papal conclave to choose the next pope. Just 1 percent of S&P 1500 companies have a CEO age 78 or older, which is interesting considering the gravity of work lawmakers have to do on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe average age for an S&P 1500 CEO is 58, which is close to the median age of a House member (57.5) in the 119th Congress, according to Pew. The median age for a senator is 64.7. But that masks some of the oldest members, including Iowa’s Charles E. Grassley (91), Vermont’s Bernie Sanders (83), McConnell (83), Maine’s Angus King (81), Connecticut’s Richard Blumenthal (79), Vermont’s Peter Welch (77), Hawaii’s Mazie K. Hirono (77) and Oregon’s Ron Wyden (75).\n\nIdaho’s Jim Risch (81), Massachusetts’ Edward J. Markey (78) and Rhode Island’s Jack Reed (75) have announced they’ll seek reelection in 2026. New Hampshire’s Jeanne Shaheen (78) bowed out recently and could be joined in retirement by Richard J. Durbin (80) of Illinois.\n\nIn the House there are 41 members age 75 or older, with Dina Titus of Nevada and Donald S. Beyer Jr. of Virginia joining them in the next couple of months. The eldest members include Harold Rogers of Kentucky (87); Maxine Waters (86), Nancy Pelosi (85), Doris Matsui (80) and John Garamendi (80) of California; Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland (85); James E. Clyburn of South Carolina (84); Danny K. Davis (83) and Jan Schakowsky (80) of Illinois; John Carter of Texas (83); Frederica S. Wilson of Florida (82); Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut (82); Virginia Foxx of North Carolina (81); Emanuel Cleaver II of Missouri (80); and Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey (80).\n\nCritics of age limits might say that institutional knowledge is important to a functioning Congress. But how’s that working out? Elderly wisdom doesn’t seem to be helping smooth things along these days. And there are plenty of members younger than 70 who know how things work.\n\nOf course, the precise amendment language would have to be worked out, perhaps by focusing on age when taking office. An official age 70 or older can’t be sworn in, for example.\n\nThat benchmark would have affected only three presidential inaugurations: Biden in 2021 (78) and Trump in both 2017 (70) and 2025 (78). It would have kept West Virginia Republican Jim Justice, 73, out of the Senate, and it would shake up next year’s Senate race in Maine, which features GOP Sen. Susan Collins, 72, and potentially Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, 77. Former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who hasn’t ruled out a Senate run next year, would be 69 in January 2027 if he happened to run and win.\n\nRather than a constitutional amendment, some folks plan to use elections to force elderly members into retirement.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Vice Chair David Hogg committed to spending $20 million through his outside group, Leaders We Deserve, to help younger, progressive challengers win primaries against older incumbents in safely Democratic districts. And younger primary challengers have already popped up this cycle against Pelosi, Schakowsky, Georgia Rep. David Scott (79) and others.\n\nGoing by history, most of these efforts will fall short. And some people will deem it a vote of confidence in the elderly and a refutation of young people. But in reality, it will have more to do with the powerful advantages of incumbency, including name ID and fundraising.\n\nConsidering the huge hurdles to be overcome, I realize that this column might have been written in vain. But if a C paper written by a 19-year-old college student could propel the 27th Amendment to be ratified after 200 years, then there’s a chance the country could finally get it right on age limits.",

    "content": "The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments Monday about the legality of the process to mandate cost-free preventive care used by millions of Americans, in a case brought by a group of Texas businesses objecting to coverage for an HIV preventive drug.\n\nThe U.S. government has asked the justices to overturn a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit which held that a preventive care task force created by the 2010 health care law is unconstitutional and threw the preventive care approved by that body into legal uncertainty.\n\nExperts said the justices, depending on how they decide the case, could end cost-free preventive care such as cancer screenings and imperil how the law handles vaccine policy and health care for children.\n\nUpholding the lower court ruling could see insurers impose costs on patients to receive the dozens of screenings and other care currently mandated by the task force, or refuse to cover them entirely, according to Andrew Twinamatsiko, director of the Center for Health Policy and Law at the O’Neill Institute of Georgetown University.\n\n“So there is a likelihood that insurers will refuse to cover them or impose high cost-sharing requirements that would dissuade people from taking preventive care,” Twinamatsiko said.\n\nThe Biden administration first asked the Supreme Court to decide the case over the United States Preventive Services Task Force, which approves which new services insurers nationwide must cover without any patient cost sharing. The Trump administration has continued the appeal.\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to decide the case before the conclusion of the court’s term at the end of June.\n\nThe case hinges on whether the structure of the task force violates the Constitution’s Appointments Clause because it makes binding decisions without the accountability of members who are confirmed by the Senate.\n\nThe challengers, a group of Texas businesses with religious objections to the task force’s approval of HIV preventive drug PrEP, initially convinced Judge Reed O’Connor of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas to invalidate the preventive care approved by the task force in a nationwide injunction.\n\nThe 5th Circuit ruling last year upheld the reasoning behind the decision but narrowed the injunction to just the challengers, rather than preventive care mandates across the country.\n\nAt the Supreme Court, the challengers argued in a brief that the task force positions require Senate confirmation because the members act as “principal officers” whose decisions are unreviewable and bind insurers.\n\nThey point to the history and structure of the task force, which existed prior to the 2010 health care law as an advisory body. Federal law requires it to be “independent and, to the extent practicable, not subject to political pressure.”\n\nAlthough the secretary of Health and Human Services can remove task force members, the law doesn’t give the administration the ability to supplant their recommendations, the challengers argued.\n\n“Indeed, no other officer can even influence the Task Force’s decisions,” the challengers argued.\n\nThe Trump administration in its Supreme Court brief argued that the secretary has the power to remove task force members or reject their recommendations, which should be enough to pass constitutional muster.\n\n“Taken together, those controls give the Secretary, not the Task Force, ultimate responsibility for whether Task Force recommendations become final, binding decisions,” the Trump administration wrote.\n\nAndrew Pincus, a partner at Mayer Brown LLP, told reporters at a press conference that the Supreme Court in the past has issued decisions that restructure how the law handles decision-makers such as the task force and could allow the preventive care mandate to survive.\n\n“I think if you look at those arguments, there’s a strong likelihood that the court will adopt the interpretation that saves the ability of the USPSTF to add services as science develops them,” Pincus said.\n\nPincus filed a brief on behalf of the American Public Health Association, which argued that invalidating the mandate could increase the cost of preventive care and increase the cost of health care overall as patients receive care later for preventable diseases and emergencies.\n\nTwinamatsiko said the Supreme Court’s decision in the case could impact ongoing litigation about coverage policy for immunizations and children’s health care, which have similar advisory bodies.\n\nThe case is Kennedy v. Braidwood Management.",

    "content": "There’s a difference between being moderate and being complacent, at least according to Rep. Josh Harder.\n\n“We have to be the party that is the angriest at the status quo,” said Harder, who serves as a vice chair of the centrist New Democrat Coalition.\n\nAs one of just 13 House Democrats who won last fall in a district carried by Donald Trump, Harder believes average Americans voted for change and ended up with chaos. The answer isn’t just to return things back to normal, the Californian argued, but to say, “Here’s where the government falls short, and here’s how we need to fix it.”\n\nHe wants Democrats to follow him in focusing on the cost of living and other “kitchen table” issues, which for the San Joaquin Valley representative includes water management. And he hopes colleagues of retirement age will treat the polite descriptor a bit more literally. “We have folks in Congress who haven’t changed a diaper in decades, or in some cases it feels like centuries,” the father of two said, adding that some were slow to respond to the baby formula shortage in 2022.\n\nHarder sat down with Roll Call recently to discuss all that, plus his hatred of nutria, love of punk and indifference to the most important meal of the day.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nQ: Water is a huge issue in your district. How do you approach that in Congress when most members from the East Coast don’t have a dog in the fight, for example, but Californians do?\n\nA: There’s an old line in California: Whiskey’s for drinking, water’s for fighting. We’ve had water wars in California for 180 years and counting, and my goal is to move away from a zero-sum mentality.\n\nA lot of projects are stealing from Peter to pay Paul and don’t create a new gallon of water for anyone in the state. They just take it from districts like mine and ship it down south. We’re trying to move that focus toward projects like desalination, which San Diego has, but it needs to be cheaper and more extensive. We’ve got to move to better water storage, better groundwater recharge — in other words, projects that make more available water for everybody.\n\nQ: This is your fourth term, but you’re still one of the younger members of Congress at 38. The median age in the House is 57. Should more of your older colleagues be thinking about retirement, especially since Democrats lost ground with Gen Z in the last election?\n\nA: I think we need leadership that matches our voters and the people we actually represent, and all too often right now that doesn’t exist. We have folks in Congress who haven’t changed a diaper in decades, or in some cases it feels like centuries. I remember when there was a baby formula shortage during COVID, I felt that I was probably the first person on Capitol Hill to understand, because my wife needed baby formula and we went to five different grocery stores and couldn’t find it anywhere.\n\nWe still haven’t gotten to the root cause of that, which is trying to fix why the market is so concentrated for baby formula and other baby products in the U.S. So I’m very concerned that could happen again, but we made it a major priority in our office.\n\nQ: You flipped your district from red to blue in 2018, and you’re now on the leadership team for the New Dems, as vice chair for member services. How do you respond to people who say Democrats, and moderates in particular, lack a vision for the nation, beyond not being Trump? That your anti-chaos message is just about preserving the status quo?\n\nA: We have to be the party that is the angriest at the status quo. And I think where we might go wrong, looking at all the disruption we’ve seen over the last few months, is trying to point to Elon Musk and DOGE and saying, “Actually, everything was perfect a couple months ago.” That’s absolutely not true. That’s not how the voters feel, and that’s not how we as Democrats should approach things.\n\nEvery moment of successful leadership in our party over the last three decades has come from a place of saying, “Here’s where the government falls short, and here’s how we need to fix it.” That was how Bill Clinton ran, that was how Barack Obama ran: the party of change and the party of government reform.\n\nQ: What does that look like at the moment?\n\nA: We need to find a way to not just have knee-jerk opposition to all the bad things that this administration may be doing, but instead say, “Look, it’s taken us 15 years to replace a bridge in my district. We don’t have enough housing, and we’re not moving forward on the most important problem to most families, which is the cost of living. We have a government that is stagnant and isn’t moving fast enough to address the everyday needs of most Americans.” That’s the message.\n\nTrump won my district. I won in a Trump seat, one of not many across the country to do that, because we prioritized those kitchen table issues, and we showed folks that anger at how the government was falling short for them.\n\nA lot of my district is on Medi-Cal, so when you talk about taking $880 billion out of a program [like Medicaid] that is essential for their daily lives, it’s an existential threat. Going forward we have to make sure we are highlighting the issues that are most important to folks. That’s what we did in 2018, which is the year I came in, and we flipped about 40 seats across the country.\n\nQ: Do you think 2026 will be another 2018?\n\nA: Too early to say. It’s not automatic. Certainly, there’s a thermostatic shift because voters in this country are frustrated by what they’re seeing from both sides, and so they’re happy to vote for government reform and against whatever party happens to be in charge at the moment.\n\nThere’s an opportunity for us to regain that mantle in 2026, but if we want to have a more permanent success going forward, we need to think about the root causes of why people are so frustrated by their government in the first place.\n\nLast book you read? “Abundance” by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson. Before that, “Hidden Potential” by Adam Grant. I have two kids, so I think a lot about their potential.\n\nFavorite thing displayed in your office? I have a picture of me in waders hunting nutria, an invasive species. There’s a lot of desk work in this job, so it’s fun to get outside and hunt some crazy swamp rats that are taking over our wetlands. It’s called the “Judas” nutria program, because you tag it and then it goes out and betrays its den.\n\nYour least popular opinion? Skipping breakfast is good for you.\n\nIn politics, can the ends justify the means? You need to have some core principles and some guardrails that you’re never going to go across. But ultimately, we need to be more outcomes-driven.\n\nOne thing your friends know about you that your constituents don’t? My taste in music. A lot of ska and punk music that I grew up with is still really important to me. It’s certainly not what I play on the campaign trail, but if Green Day or The Offspring want to come out to Stockton, we’d welcome them anytime.",

    "content": "The Supreme Court will decide the future of President Donald Trump’s effort to overturn birthright citizenship, agreeing Thursday to hear oral arguments next month.\n\nRather than rule on the Trump administration’s requests to pause rulings from lower courts in Washington, New Jersey and Maryland that kept the policy unchanged, the justices set oral arguments for May 15 on the issue. The Trump administration asked the justices to intervene last month after several lower courts ruled that his policy likely violated the Constitution.\n\nThe justices would likely rule in the case before the end of the court’s term in June.\n\nThe case is the most high-profile test of Trump’s effort to overturn birthright citizenship through executive order. After campaigning on a promise to end the guarantee, Trump signed an executive order to do so on his first day in office. The order excludes from birthright citizenship children born to people in the United States without legal status or those on temporary visas.\n\nStates and others challenging the executive order have said in court filings that it could strip citizenship from hundreds of thousands of children each year.\n\nA federal judge in Washington barred the order’s enforcement in January. Since then multiple courts have ruled that the order likely violates the Constitution, federal immigration law and federal administrative law.\n\nThe U.S. Courts of Appeal for the 1st, 4th and 9th circuits have rejected the Trump administration’s appeals to allow enforcement while the case works its way through the courts, so the Trump administration turned to the justices.\n\nThe administration argues that the lower-court judges overstepped their bounds. The government said in court filings that a provision in the 14th Amendment requires people to be “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States to receive birthright citizenship, and that Trump has the power to exclude the children of noncitizens without the need for Congress to act.\n\nThe Justice Department’s Supreme Court applications also criticized lower court judges in general for ruling against the administration with nationwide injunctions, saying it has “reached a fever pitch” since Trump’s inauguration.\n\nThe states and groups challenging the order argued that the policy ran up against more than a century of history as well as the text of the Constitution. In a brief led by New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin, one group of challengers argued that it would strip hundreds of thousands of American-born children of citizenship and “inflict tremendous and irreparable harms” on the country.\n\n“For over 100 years, this Court, Congress, and the Executive Branch have all agreed that the Constitution guarantees citizenship to children born in this country, including those born to undocumented or non-permanent immigrants,” the challengers wrote.\n\nThe cases are Trump et al. v. CASA Inc. et al.; Trump et al. v. Washington, et al.; and Trump et al. v. New Jersey et al.",

On Tuesday, it gained its second high-profile contender, Representative Andy Barr.\n\nBy Nick Corasaniti\n\nThe race in Kentucky to succeed Senator Mitch McConnell, an omnipresent force in Republican politics for 40 years, is shaping up to be one of the biggest and most expensive G.O.P. clashes of 2026.\n\nRepresentative Andy Barr, a Republican who was first elected to Congress in 2012, announced on Tuesday that he was running for the seat that will be vacated by Mr. McConnell’s retirement. Mr. Barr’s candidacy sets up a Republican primary battle against Daniel Cameron, a former state attorney general and a protégé of Mr. McConnell’s.\n\nWhile Mr. Barr and Mr. Cameron are the only official G.O.P. candidates so far, several other well-known Kentucky Republicans, including Nate Morris, a wealthy businessman with ties to Vice President JD Vance and Donald Trump Jr., have indicated an interest in the seat.\n\nThe Republican primary race will revolve around two party titans — President Trump and Mr. McConnell — whose approval among conservatives has sharply diverged. The candidates will feel compelled to demonstrate their pro-Trump credentials as they jockey for the president’s coveted endorsement. That battle is poised to lead to increased public criticism of Mr. McConnell, whose popularity among Republican voters has taken a nosedive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a two-minute video on social media announcing his candidacy, Mr. Barr made no mention of Mr. McConnell but brought up Mr. Trump four times.\n\n“I’m running for Senate to help our president save this great country,” he says in the video. He later adds, “Working with President Trump, I’ll fight to create jobs for hardworking Kentuckians, instead of warm and fuzzies for hard-core liberals.”\n\nSubscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.\n\nNick Corasaniti is a Times reporter covering national politics, with a focus on voting and elections.\n\nAdvertisement",

    "content": "Trump Administration\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nThe I.M.F. and World Bank are holding their spring meetings as President Trump’s trade war upends the global economy.\n\nBy Alan Rappeport\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nGlobal economic leaders are gathering in Washington this week for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. They are arriving in a United States that is vastly different from the one they visited during the same forum last fall.\n\nRecent debates over industrial policy and whether the world economy could achieve a soft landing have been replaced by anxiety over President Trump’s trade war, revived inflation fears and new worries about the prospect of a global recession. The multilateral institutions that are hosting the meetings and that receive funding from the United States are also under increasing pressure to prove their relevance to the Trump administration while avoiding confrontations that could compel Mr. Trump to withdraw from them entirely.\n\n“The post-World War II rules-based system of global governance, which the United States played a key role in fashioning, is crumbling before our eyes,” said Eswar Prasad, a former China director of the I.M.F.\n\n“The Trump administration has left little doubt about its distaste for practically every multilateral institution, including the I.M.F. and the World Bank, because it views these institutions’ recommendations and policies as not always perfectly aligned with narrowly defined American interests,” Mr. Prasad said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr. Trump has ratcheted up tariffs to their highest levels in more than a century, creating widespread global economic uncertainty and most likely disrupting supply chains. At the same time, a sharp pullback in U.S. foreign aid is putting sudden pressure on poor countries that have for decades relied on American support to provide food and medicines for the world’s most vulnerable populations.\n\nMr. Trump has said little publicly about the I.M.F. or the World Bank since taking office in January. But officials at both institutions have been watching warily as the president upends the global trading system, rapidly overhauls the federal government and cracks down on foreign nationals working and studying in the United States.\n\nSubscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.\n\nAlan Rappeport is an economic policy reporter for The Times, based in Washington.

You must cooperate as fully as reasonably required in the defense of any such claim. NYT reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you.\n\n5.2 NYT does not represent or endorse the accuracy or reliability of any advice, opinion, statement, or other information displayed, uploaded, or distributed through the Services by any user, information provider or any other person or entity.

IF ANY APPLICABLE AUTHORITY HOLDS ANY PORTION OF THIS SECTION TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE NYT PARTIES' LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST POSSIBLE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n\n6.

You also can be requested to provide certain registration information, which must be accurate and updated, or verify your account or contact information.\n\nEach registration is for a single user only. You are not allowed to share your registration login credentials or give your login credentials to anyone else. We may cancel or suspend your access to the Services if you share your login credentials. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, which you will not have to reveal to any representative or agent of NYT. You may not: (1) select or use the login credentials of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; (2) use login credentials in which another person has rights without such person's authorization; or (3) use login credentials that we, in our sole discretion, deem offensive. Failure to comply with these requirements will constitute a breach of these Terms of Service, which may result in immediate suspense or termination of your account. You must provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself.\n\nYou consent to receive notifications from us electronically to the e-mail address you provide to us. You agree that all notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing. You agree that you have the ability to store such electronic communications such that they remain accessible to you in an unchanged form.\n\n6.2 Please notify us of any known or suspected unauthorized use(s) of your account, or any known or suspected breach of security, including loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your password or credit card information.\n\n6.3 You must be 13 years or older to use any part of the Services in the USA and the UK, and 16 years or older anywhere else.

Any fraudulent, abusive, or otherwise illegal activity or activity that violates these Terms of Service, the Crossplay Acceptable Use Policy, or other applicable terms and conditions may be grounds for termination of your account, at our sole discretion, and we may refer you to appropriate law-enforcement agencies.\n\n6.5 If your access to any Service has been provided by or through a third party (for example, your employer or an educational institution at which you are a student) (each, a “Client”), the Client may have provided us with information about you to enable us to provide you with access to the Services and distinguish you from other subscribers (such as your IP address, email address or name).\n\n6.6. We cannot and do not guarantee that any of the Services will be free from viruses or other code that may have contaminating or destructive elements. It is your responsibility to implement appropriate IT security safeguards (including anti-virus and other security checks) to satisfy your particular requirements as to the safety and reliability of the Services.\n\n6.7. If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third party, you agree that NYT is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release NYT, its subsidiaries, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services.\n\n7. FEES AND PAYMENTS\n\n7.1. We reserve the right at any time to charge fees for access to portions of the Services or the Services as a whole. In no event, however, will you be charged for access to the Services unless we obtain your prior agreement to pay such charges. Thus, if at any time we require a fee for portions of the Services that are now free, we will give you advance notice of such fees. You may cancel your account at any time (see Section 10.1 regarding termination of service). All new fees, if any, will be posted prominently on the Site and in other appropriate locations on the Service. You must pay all fees and charges incurred through your account at the rates in effect for the billing period in which such fees and charges are incurred, including, but not limited to charges for any digital products or services offered for sale through the Services by us or by any other vendor or service provider. All fees and charges will be billed to and paid for by you. You shall pay all applicable taxes relating to use of the Services through your account.\n\n8. THIRD-PARTY CONTENT AND LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES.\n\n8.1 The Services contain links to third-party websites, services, resources, and advertisers (collectively, “Linked Content”). NYT does not control, endorse, sponsor, recommend or otherwise accept responsibility for any of this Linked Content. Because we are not responsible for the availability of these outside resources, or their contents or privacy practices, you should direct any concerns regarding any Linked Content to such site. When you access Linked Content, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that NYT is not responsible for such risks. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third-party website or service that you visit or utilize. Because we are not responsible for the availability of these outside resources, or their contents or privacy practices, you should direct any concerns regarding any Linked Content to such site.\n\nIn addition, NYT will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor, or edit the content of any third-party site or service. By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website or service.\n\nYour interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties, or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties. You agree that NYT shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.\n\n9. SOFTWARE LICENSES\n\nWe grant you a limited, revocable, and non-transferable license to use the mobile applications (“Apps”) on devices you own or have a legal right to use in accordance with these Terms of Service, the Terms of Sale (where applicable), and any additional terms specific to the particular application. You have no rights to the proprietary software and related documentation, or any enhancements or modifications thereto, provided to you in order to access the Services (“Software”).

Cancellation of paid digital products will be governed by our Cancellation and Refund Policy for Digital Products. Please note that terminating your NYT account does not automatically terminate your account with The Athletic. To terminate your account with The Athletic, please contact us directly at nytimes.com/athletic/contact-support.\n\n10.2 NYT may, in its sole discretion, terminate or suspend your access to all or part of the Services for any reason, including, without limitation, breach or assignment of these Terms of Service, the Crossplay Acceptable Use Policy, or other applicable terms and conditions.\n\n10.3 The provisions of these Terms of Service will survive the termination of your account or access to all or part of the Services.\n\n11. GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION\n\n11.1 These Terms of Service have been made and will be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the United States of America and the State of New York as an agreement wholly performed in the State of New York without regard to their conflict of law provisions and the United Nations Conventions on Contracts (if applicable).\n\n11.2 Any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Services or these Terms of Services must be filed within one year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.\n\n12. WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS; ARBITRATION\n\n12.1 Binding Arbitration. You and NYT agree that, except for i) claims related to intellectual property, and ii) any claims that may be brought in small claims court where the amount in controversy is properly within the jurisdiction of such court (collectively, “Excluded Claims”), any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Terms of Service, the Terms of Sale, your relationship to NYT as a subscriber, or your use of any of NYT’s Services, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory (the “Covered Claims”), will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The parties further agree that the determination of the scope, enforceability, or applicability of this Arbitration Agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part thereof of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment of administrative or arbitrator fees (including the timing of such payments and remedies for nonpayment) will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement. YOUR AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATION MEANS THAT FOR ALL COVERED CLAIMS, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY.  INSTEAD, YOU WILL HAVE A HEARING BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, an arbitrator may consolidate more than one person's claims if the NYT provides consent to such consolidation in writing. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief) and all appeals have been exhausted or the decision is otherwise final, then the parties agree that such a claim or request for relief shall be decided by a court only after all other claims and requests for relief are arbitrated.\n\n12.3 Conduct of Arbitration; Governing Rules; Informal Resolution.  Arbitrations for any disputes between us relating to the Covered Claims will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Rules for Multiple Case Filings (collectively, the “AAA Rules”). For more information about arbitration, the AAA and the arbitration process, please consult the American Arbitration Association web site at adr.org. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope, application, and enforceability of the arbitration provision–including whether any claims are Covered Claims or Excluded Claims within the meaning of this provision–are for the court to decide.  As stated in Section 11, New York law applies to any arbitration under this section, but the parties acknowledge that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.\n\nPrior to initiating arbitration for a Covered Claim, both parties agree that they will provide written notice of the potential claim to the opposing party setting forth: (1) the factual and legal basis for the claim; (2) contact information for the potential claimant and their counsel, if any; and (3) the remedies sought, including the amount of claimed monetary damages (the “Notice”). Such written notice shall be provided on an individualized basis. Following receipt of the Notice by the opposing party, the parties agree to make a good faith effort for at least 60 days to resolve the claim before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including, without limitation, arbitration or any court action. To provide notice of a claim to NYT, write to legal@nytimes.com or The New York Times Company, Attn: Legal Department, 620 Eighth Avenue, New York, NY 10018. If you are an Athletic account holder or subscriber, any demand filed by you initiating arbitration must include the email address you used to log onto The Athletic, as well as any profile associated with that account that is controlled by you.\n\nThe aforementioned informal dispute resolution process is a prerequisite and condition precedent to commencing any formal dispute resolution proceeding. The parties agree that any relevant limitations period and filing fees or other deadlines will be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process.\n\nUnless you and NYT agree otherwise in writing, any hearings for the arbitration will take place (i) in a location to be determined in accordance with the AAA Rules that is reasonably convenient for you and is no more than 100 miles from your home or place of business; or (ii) at another location you and we agree upon. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, except that if the arbitrator finds at any time that a claim was filed frivolously, for purposes of harassment, or otherwise in bad faith, then the filing party will reimburse the other party for all costs and fees, including attorneys’ fees, associated with that claim.\n\nJudgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located in the County of New York in the State of New York. The arbitrator may award money or equitable relief in favor of only the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. To reduce the time and expense of the arbitration, the arbitrator will not provide a statement of reasons for his or her award unless requested to do so by both parties.\n\n12.4 Mass Arbitrations. To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, in the event 25 or more similar arbitration demands (those asserting the same or substantially similar facts or claims, and seeking the same or substantially similar relief) presented by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm(s) or organization(s) are submitted to AAA against NYT (a “Mass Filing”), the parties agree (i) to administer the Mass Filing in batches of 10 demands per batch (to the extent there are fewer than 10 arbitration demands left over after the batching described above, a final batch will consist of the remaining demands) with only one batch filed, processed, and adjudicated at a time; (ii) to designate one arbitrator for each demand within the batch (the same arbitrator may preside over multiple demands in a batch if the relevant claimants and NYT so agree); (iii) to accept applicable fees, including any related fee reduction determined by AAA in its discretion; (iv) that no other demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filing may be filed, processed, or adjudicated until the prior batch of 10 is filed, processed, and adjudicated; (v) that fees associated with a demand for arbitration included in a Mass Filing, including fees owed by NYT and the claimants, shall only be due after your demand for arbitration is included in a set of batch proceedings and that batch is properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication; (vi) that the staged process of batched proceedings, with each set including 10 demands, shall continue until each demand (including your demand) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved; and (vii) to make good faith efforts to resolve each batch of demands within 180-days, failing which any of the claimants or NYT may cease arbitration and file in a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nArbitrator selection for the demands in each batch shall be conducted to the greatest extent possible in accordance with the applicable AAA rules and procedures for such selection, and the arbitrator will determine the location where the proceedings for each demand within a batch will be conducted. You agree to cooperate in good faith with NYT and the arbitration provider to implement such a “batch approach” or other similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the payment of combined reduced fees, set by AAA in its discretion, for each batch of demands. The parties further agree to cooperate with each other and the arbitration provider or arbitrator to establish any other processes or procedures that the arbitration provider or arbitrator believe will provide for an efficient resolution of claims. Any disagreement between the parties as to whether this provision applies or as to the process or procedure for batching shall be resolved by a procedural arbitrator appointed by AAA. This “Batch Arbitration” provision shall in no way be interpreted as increasing the number of demands necessary to trigger the applicability of AAA’s Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules or authorizing class arbitration of any kind. Unless NYT otherwise consents in writing, NYT does not agree or consent to class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in this section 12.4. If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, your claims will remain tolled until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled. The parties agree that this batching provision is integral to this Section 12 insofar as it applies to a Mass Filing. If the batching provision in this Section 12.4 or the engagement of a mediator in Section 12.5 is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Section 12 shall be null and void, and neither you nor NYT shall be entitled to arbitrate any claim that is a part of the Mass Filing.\n\n12.5 Mediation Following First Batch in a Mass Filing. The results of the first batch of demands will be given to a AAA mediator selected from a group of 5 mediators initially proposed by AAA, with NYT and the remaining claimants’ counsel being able to strike one mediator each and then rank the remaining mediators and the highest collectively ranked mediator being selected. The selected mediator will try to facilitate a resolution of the remaining demands in the Mass Filing. After the results are provided to the mediator, NYT, the remaining claimants and their counsel, and the mediator will have 90 days (the “Mediation Period”) to agree on a resolution or substantive methodology for resolving the outstanding demands. If the parties are unable to resolve the outstanding demands during the Mediation Period and cannot agree on a methodology for resolving them through further arbitrations, either NYT or any remaining claimant may opt out of the arbitration process and have the demand(s) proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction. Notice of the opt-out will be provided in writing within 60 days of the close of the Mediation Period. If neither NYT nor the remaining claimants opt out and they cannot agree to a methodology for resolving the remaining demands through further arbitration, the arbitrations will continue with the batching process. Absent notice of an opt-out, the arbitrations will proceed in the order determined by the sequential numbers assigned to demands in the Mass Filing.\n\n12.6 Opt-out. You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to legal@nytimes.com with the subject line “ARBITRATION OPT-OUT.” The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of (a) May 10, 2024; or (b) your first use of the Services, whichever is later. Otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, you may exercise your right to a trial by jury or judge, as permitted by applicable law, but any prior existing agreement to arbitrate disputes under any prior Arbitration Agreement between you and NYT will not apply to claims not yet filed regardless of when those claims may have accrued. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, NYT also will not be bound by it.\n\n12.7 For all litigation regarding Excluded Claims and any other controversy or claim for which arbitration is denied, the sole jurisdiction and venue for such litigation will be an appropriate federal or state court located in the County of New York in the State of New York.\n\n12.8 All provisions of this Section 12 will survive termination of these Terms of Service and the Terms of Sale, your relationship with us, and/or your account or profile.\n\n13. MISCELLANEOUS\n\n13.1 These Terms of Service have been made in and will be construed and enforced in accordance with New York law. Any action to enforce these Terms of Service must be brought in the federal or state courts located in New York City.\n\n13.2 Nothing in these Terms of Service will serve to preempt the promises made in our Privacy Policy.\n\n13.3 Correspondence should be sent to our Customer Care team.\n\n13.4 You agree to report any violations of the Terms of Service to NYT as soon as you become aware of them. In the event you have a claim of copyright infringement with respect to material that is contained in a Service, please notify copyrights@nytimes.com.

Alito Jr. said. “They’re just saying, ‘Look, we want out.’ Why isn’t that feasible? What is the big deal about allowing them to opt out of this?”\n\nJustice Brett M.

Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., broke his silence on Tuesday after an unearthed social media post of rap lyrics set off a firestorm of controversy.\n\nFrost, who recently made headlines for flying to El Salvador to visit deported illegal immigrant and alleged MS-13 gang member Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was heavily criticized on social media after a seemingly cryptic tweet from 2016 resurfaced reading \"f----- wit my gang gon get u spilled.\"\n\nThe post was in response to tweets including one by an account named \"Hits LeBlunt.\" The line is from the song \"Gang\" by rapper \"Max P.\"\n\nThe post generated a spate of concern and condemnation, with many saying it was unbecoming of a member of Congress to have such a post on his official account.\n\nTRACE GALLAGHER: THE LEFT IS ‘ALL IN’ ON KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA\n\nFar-left Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Florida, (left) broke his silence on Tuesday after an unearthed social media post of rap lyrics set off a firestorm of controversy with even Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele (right) weighing in.  (Frost For Congress Alex Peña/Getty Images)\n\nEven Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who has emerged as a key ally of the Trump administration, weighed in on the controversy by posting a shoulder shrug emoji.\n\nRather than deleting the post, Frost simply responded to the controversy by saying, \"Never thought Max P lyrics I tweeted at 19 would get so much attention from MAGA.\"\n\nFrost also tweeted out \"I’ve only ever been in one gang\" with an image of him in his high school band.\n\nFrost kept going, tweeting again on Tuesday, \"Keep looking through my old posts.

Most likely referring to blood being spilled.\"\n\nPopular conservative account \"End Wokeness\" replied to Frost’s 2016 tweet by saying, \"DeMS-13 or Tren Dem Aragua?\"\n\nOthers, like the popular account \"DataRepublican,\" expressed that the tweet was not fitting for a member of Congress.\n\n\"You are a Congressman. You're not a gangster. You're not being cool or edgy. You are held to a high standard, as a representative of the mightiest nation on the Earth.

Company does not represent that the Company Content or the Company Services are appropriate (or, in some cases, available) for use in other locations. If you use the Company Sites or the Company Services from a jurisdiction other than the United States, you agree that you do so of your own initiative, and you are responsible for complying with local laws as applicable to your use of the Company Sites or the Company Services.\n\nNot all of the Site Products are available worldwide or nationwide, and Company makes no representation that you will be able to obtain any Site Product in any particular jurisdiction, either within or outside of the United States.\n\nU.S. Export Controls\n\nSoftware available in connection with the Company Services is further subject to United States export controls. No such software may be downloaded from the Company Services or otherwise exported or re-exported in violation of U.S. export laws. Downloading or using such software is at your sole risk.\n\nInformal Dispute Resolution Procedure, Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver\n\nSo that Company can maintain the ability to offer you and other users the Company Service, you and Company agree to the following mechanisms for resolving any Dispute between us:\n\na. Dispute. The term \"Dispute\" is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any dispute, claim, demand, count, cause of action, or controversy between you and Company, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, or any other intentional tort), or any other legal or equitable theory. The term \"Dispute\" specifically includes, but is not limited to, any disputes, actions, claims, or controversies between you and Company that arise from or in any way relate to or concern any Content, the Company Sites or services provided by Company including but not limited to the Company Services (as defined above), this Arbitration Section, any other aspect of this Agreement or any prior versions of this Agreement (including their applicability and their conformance to applicable law), and any disputes relating to telephonic, text message, or any other communications either of us received from the other. The only exceptions to this Arbitration Section are that: (i) each of you and Company retains the right to sue in small claims court; (ii) each of you and Company may bring suit in court against the other to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights; and (iii) each of you and Company may bring suit in court to determine the enforceability of Sub-Section b. and/or Sub-Section k. of this Arbitration Section.\n\nb. Mandatory Informal Dispute Resolution Process. You and Company agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective, and mutually beneficial outcome. Therefore, if either you or Company wants to bring or resolve a Dispute, you or Company must follow the mandatory informal dispute resolution process as a precondition to the ability to file an arbitration demand or lawsuit:\n\ni. Notice. You or Company must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\") that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving notice, the specific facts giving rise to the Dispute, the Company Service to which the Notice relates, and the relief requested, including damages, if any, and a detailed calculation for them. Your Notice also must contain your email address and (if different) the email address associated with your Company account (if you have an account with Company). Our Notice must also be sent to your email address associated with your Company account (if you have an account with Company), and you consent to receive any such Notice as part of these dispute resolution terms. You and we must include in any Notice to each other a personally signed statement (from you or us—not from your or our counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice, and if you are represented by counsel, your signed statement authorizing Company to disclose your Company account details to your attorney while seeking to resolve your claim. We each must individualize our Notice, meaning it can concern only our Dispute and no other person’s Dispute. You must send your Notice to Company by email to Arbitration-Notice@fox.com or by mail to: Arbitration Notice of Dispute, Fox Corporation, 2121 Avenue of the Stars, Suite 1200, Los Angeles, California, 90067. In the case of a Dispute initiated by you or us, it is the sender’s responsibility to prove that the sender provided the notice in the manner that is required in this paragraph.\n\nii. Good Faith Effort to Informally Resolve Dispute. After receipt of a completed Notice, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the Dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement). You and Company agree that, after receipt of the completed Notice, the recipient may request an individualized telephone or video settlement conference and both parties will personally attend (with counsel, if represented). You and Company agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) shall work cooperatively to schedule the conference at the earliest mutually convenient time and to seek to reach a resolution. If you and Company do not reach an agreement to resolve the issues identified in the Notice within 60 days after the completed Notice is received (or a longer time if agreed to by the parties), you or Company may commence a proceeding as noted below.\n\nc. Arbitration Agreement. If you and we do not resolve the Dispute within 60 days of the submission of the Notice in accordance with the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures, Company, including its Affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, and you agree that any Dispute between you and Company, regarding any aspect of your relationship with Company, will be resolved in a binding, confidential, individual and fair arbitration process, and not in court, subject to the exceptions noted in Sub-Section g. below of this Arbitration Section. Thus, subject to those exceptions, you and Company agree to give up the right to sue in court, including that you and Company agree to waive their right to a jury trial.\n\nd. Controlling Law Regarding Arbitration Process and Agreement to Arbitrate. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1–16, governs the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions in this Arbitration Section related to the arbitration process. The agreements in this Arbitration Section shall survive termination of the Agreement. Any original action to compel arbitration under Section 4 of the FAA (or analogous state law) must be brought in a state or federal court located in New York City, unless mandated by law to be filed in another state or federal court. If the FAA is found to not apply to any issue regarding the interpretation or enforcement of the parties’ agreement to arbitrate, then that issue shall be determined by the laws of the State of New York. Any arbitration between you and Company will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") pursuant to their then-applicable rules, including their mass arbitration supplementary rules and mass arbitration fee schedule, as applicable, as modified by this Arbitration Section. AAA’s rules and fee schedules can be found at www.adr.org. Except in the event of a Mass Filing as described in Sub-Section k. below of this Arbitration Section, the arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. If you and Company cannot agree on an arbitrator, the arbitrator will be appointed pursuant to the AAA’s rules.\n\ne. Alternative Arbitration Provider. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, including because it is not able to administer the arbitration(s) consistent with the rules, procedures, and terms of this Arbitration Section, including those described in Sub-Section k., the parties will select an alternative arbitration provider. If the parties cannot agree on an appropriate alternative arbitration provider, then the parties will ask a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 5 that is able to administer the arbitration(s) consistent with the rules, procedures, and terms of this Arbitration Section, including, as applicable, Sub-Section k. of this Arbitration Section will govern to the extent it conflicts with the arbitration provider’s rules. For arbitrations before the AAA, the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules and Optional Rules For Emergency Measures of Protection shall apply.\n\nf. Filing Fee and Costs. The initiating party must pay all filing fees for the arbitration. Your and Company's responsibility to pay other administrative and arbitrator costs will be as set forth in the applicable arbitration provider’s rules, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. If a claim is determined to be frivolous, the claimant is responsible for reimbursing the respondent for its portion of all such administrative, hearing, and/or other fees incurred as a result of the frivolous claim.\n\ng. Waiver of Fees and Costs. You may qualify for a waiver of certain arbitration costs under the applicable arbitration provider’s rules or other applicable law. If you meet the standard for proceeding in forma pauperis in federal court, the state court of your residence, or the state court where the arbitration is brought, cannot obtain a waiver from the arbitration provider of any filing fees you are required to pay, and the arbitration provider refuses to administer the arbitration without your payment of said fees, Company will pay the filing fees for you.\n\nh. Enforceability of Certain Provisions of this Arbitration Section. Notwithstanding Sub-Section c. through Sub-Section g. of this Arbitration Section, a claim regarding enforceability of any portion of Sub-Section b. and/or Sub-Section k. of this Arbitration Section must be brought in federal or state court. Courts shall have the exclusive authority to determine: (i) the enforceability of any or all of the procedures set forth in Sub-Section b. and/or Sub-Section k. of this Arbitration Section; and (ii) if any or all the procedures set forth in Sub-Section b. and/or Sub-Section k. of this Arbitration Section are unenforceable, whether that or those procedures are severable from the remaining provisions of this Arbitration Section and the consequences of said severance. If the court determines that Sub-Section b. of this Arbitration Section is enforceable, it will also decide whether the party seeking to arbitrate the Dispute complied with the process in Sub-Section b. of this Arbitration Section.\n\ni. You and Company also agree to give up the ability to seek to represent, in a class action or otherwise, anyone but each of you and Company, including in arbitration and in state or federal court. Therefore:\n\nYOU AND COMPANY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR MULTI-CLAIMANT PROCEEDING, AND THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE NO POWER TO AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF\n\nj. You understand there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. An arbitrator must follow the dispute resolution process described in this Arbitration Section. Subject to Sub-Section h. of this Arbitration Section, the arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve all issues relating to the parties’ Dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief, or statutory damages); provided that they are recoverable under this Agreement. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.\n\nk. Related Cases and Mass Filings. If your Notice involves claims similar to those of at least 25 other customers, and if you and those other customers are represented by the same lawyers, or by lawyers who are coordinating with each other, or if Company asserts 25 or more similar demands for arbitration or counterclaims against similarly-situated parties, within a period of 60 days or otherwise close in proximity, you and we agree that these claims will be related (\"Related Cases\"), and this shall be called a \"Mass Filing.\" The following procedures will apply to a Mass Filing:\n\ni. Acknowledgment of Related Cases procedure. If you or Company, or your or our counsel, files a demand for arbitration that has Related Cases, then you and we agree that the demand for arbitration shall be subject to the additional protocols set forth in this Sub-Section k. of this Arbitration Section. If the parties disagree as to whether a series of filings fits within the definition of Mass Filing above, the arbitration provider shall resolve the disagreement. You and we also acknowledge that the adjudication of the dispute may be delayed and that any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled from the time of filing of the demand for arbitration, and pending resolution of the proceedings described in this Sub-Section k. of this Arbitration Section.\n\nii. Bellwether Arbitrations. Bellwether proceedings are encouraged by courts and arbitration administrators where there are multiple disputes involving similar claims against the same or related parties. The parties shall select ten individual arbitration claims (five per side), designated the \"Initial Test Cases,\" to proceed to arbitration. Only the Initial Test Cases shall be filed with the arbitrator. All other claims shall be held in abeyance. This means that the filing fees will be paid only for the Initial Test Cases; for all other demands for arbitration, the filing fees (together with any arbitrator consideration of the other demands) will be in abeyance, and neither You nor Company will be required to pay any such filing fees. You and Company also agree that neither you nor we shall be deemed to be in breach of this Arbitration Section for failure to pay any such filing fees, and that neither you nor we shall be entitled to any contractual, statutory, or other remedies, damages, or sanctions of any kind for failure to pay any such filing fees. If, pursuant to this subsection, a party files non-Bellwether Arbitrations with the arbitration provider, the parties agree that the arbitration provider shall hold those demands in abeyance and not refer them to the arbitrator pending resolution of the Initial Test Cases. Unless the claims are resolved in advance or the schedule is extended, the arbitrators will render a final award for the Initial Test Cases within 120 days of the initial pre-hearing conference.\n\niii. Global Mediation. Following the resolution of the Initial Test Cases, the parties agree to engage in a global mediation of all the remaining individual arbitration claims (\"Global Mediation\"), deferring any filing costs associated with the non-Initial Test Cases until the Initial Test Cases and subsequent Global Mediation have concluded. After the final awards are provided to the mediator in the Initial Test Cases, the mediator and the parties shall have 90 days to agree upon a substantive methodology and make an offer to resolve the outstanding cases. If the Parties are unable to resolve the outstanding claims during the Global Mediation, the unresolved Disputes may then be administered by the arbitration provider pursuant to this Agreement’s Batch Arbitration provision below and the arbitrator’s fee schedule for mass filings, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise in writing. You and we also acknowledge that any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled pending resolution of the Bellwether Arbitration and Global Mediation process.\n\niv. Batch Arbitration. To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Company agree that in the event the Bellwether Arbitration and Global Mediation processes described above do not resolve the Disputes, the arbitration provider will (1) administer the remaining arbitration demands in batches of 50 demands per batch; (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (\"Batch Arbitration\"). The final award will provide for individual merit decisions for each separate claimant within the single batch arbitration award. If the arbitration provider will not administer the Batch Arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, then the arbitration provider’s mass arbitration fee schedule shall apply. AAA’s mass arbitration fee schedule is available on its website at www.adr.org/rules. For mass arbitrations before any other arbitration provider, if applicable, you and Company agree that its mass arbitration fee schedule shall apply, as necessary.\n\nv. Opting Out. If your claim is not resolved as part of the Bellwether Arbitration and Global Mediation process outlined above, the parties shall also have the opportunity to opt out of arbitration and bring the pending Dispute to the state or federal courts located in New York City, unless mandated by law to be filed in another state or federal court. The parties have 30 days of the failed Global Mediation process to opt out. This shall not provide an opportunity for either party to opt out of arbitration for other claims. You may opt out of arbitration by providing written notice of your intention to opt out to the arbitration provider and to Fox Corporation, Attention Arbitration Opt-Out, 2121 Avenue of the Stars, Suite 1200, Los Angeles, California, 90067 via USPS Priority Mail or hand delivery, by email to Arbitration-OptOut@fox.com, or by notice to the attorney representing Company in the arbitration proceeding. This written notice must be signed by you, even if it is also signed by your attorney. The written notice cannot be signed by an agent or other representative of yours in lieu of your signature. It must include a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration within 30 days after the conclusion of the Global Mediation process. Company may exercise its equivalent opt-out right by sending written notice to you or your attorney, agent, or representative if you are represented.\n\nvi. Enforcement of Subsection. A Court of competent jurisdiction shall have the power to enforce Sub-Section k. of this Arbitration Section, including by injunctive, declaratory, or other relief.\n\nl. Live Testimony. You must appear to testify at any arbitration hearing personally, virtually, or in another manner authorized by law or the arbitration provider. You agree that if you fail to appear in one of these forms to testify, you consent to have the arbitrator order that the case be closed immediately.\n\nm. Discovery and Information Exchange. Regardless of how the arbitration proceeds, each of you and Company shall cooperate in good faith in the exchange of non-privileged documents and information as necessary in accordance with the arbitration provider’s rules.\n\nn. Attorney’s Fees and Fee Shifting. Each of you and Company may incur attorneys’ fees during the arbitration. Each side agrees to pay his, her or its own attorneys’ fees unless the claim(s) at issue permit(s) the prevailing party to be paid its attorneys’ fees, and in such instance, the fees awarded shall be determined by the applicable law(s).\n\no. Restrictions on Forms of Relief. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief, only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim, only as permitted by applicable law, and only to the extent that declaratory and injunctive relief are permitted by this Agreement. The arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive, exemplary, multiplied or consequential damages or any other relief except those allowed under the law and this Agreement, including Limitation of Liability provisions. The arbitrator also may not order you or Company to pay any monies to or take any actions with respect to persons other than you or Company, respectively, unless you or Company explicitly consents in advance, after an arbitrator is selected, to permit the arbitrator to enter such an order, as applicable. Further, unless you and Company expressly agree, or subject to the provisions of Sub-Section k. above of this Arbitration Section, the arbitrator may not consolidate other persons’ claims with yours or ours, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, multi-claimant or class proceeding.\n\np. Confidentiality. You and Company agree to maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and shall not disclose the fact of the arbitration, any documents exchanged as part of any mediation, proceedings of the arbitration, the arbitrator’s decision and the existence or amount of any award, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration (in which case anyone becoming privy to confidential information must undertake to preserve its confidentiality), or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a provisional remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, an order confirming the award, or unless otherwise required by law or court order. In keeping with the confidential nature of the arbitration, you and Company agree that an order confirming the award is only necessary if the obligations of the award have not been performed. Therefore, before taking any steps to confirm the arbitration award, the party seeking confirmation of the award must give the other party notice of its intention to confirm the award. If the party who would be the respondent in any such confirmation proceeding performs its obligation under the terms of the arbitration award within 15 business days of such notice, the party who gave notice of its intent to confirm the award shall not seek to confirm or otherwise enforce the award.\n\nq. Severability of Portions of this Arbitration Section. With the exception of Sub-Section i. and Sub-Section k. of this Arbitration Section (i.e., the waiver of the ability to proceed on behalf of multiple claimants or a purported class and the Mass Filing procedure), if any part of this Arbitration Section is deemed invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the balance of this Arbitration Section shall remain in effect and be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, or illegal provision were not contained. If, however, either or both Sub-Section i. or/and Sub-Section k. of this Arbitration Section is found invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the remainder of this Arbitration Section and this paragraph shall be null and void, but the rest of this Agreement, including the provisions governing in which court actions against Company must be pursued and the choice of governing law will remain in effect and apply to any claim that, for this or any other reason, proceeds in court rather than in arbitration.\n\nr. Court Proceedings. If a court issues a decision precluding or refusing to compel arbitration of any Dispute, the Dispute must be brought in the state or federal courts located in New York City, unless otherwise mandated by law to be filed in another state or federal court. For Disputes deemed not to be subject to arbitration, neither you nor Company shall be precluded from participating in a class-wide settlement of those claims if brought by another Company user or third party.\n\nGoverning Law\n\nThe Agreement will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.\n\nExcept with respect to Disputes to be resolved through the process in accordance with the Arbitration Agreement contained above, you and Company agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in New York, New York, unless otherwise mandated by law, to resolve any Dispute arising out of the Agreement or the Company Services. YOU HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIMS, COUNTERCLAIMS, CROSS-CLAIMS, OR THIRD PARTY CLAIMS) ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.\n\nYOU AND WE AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION YOU OR WE MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY SITES OR THE COMPANY SERVICES MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. AFTER SUCH PERIOD, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE PERMANENTLY BARRED.\n\nIndemnity\n\nYou agree to indemnify and hold Company, its Company Affiliates, subcontractors and other partners, and their respective officers, agents, partners and employees, harmless from any loss, liability, claim, or demand, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of or in connection with YOUR BREACH OF YOUR REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS OR AGREEMENTS HEREUNDER; YOUR VIOLATION OF THIS AGREEMENT OF USE OR ANY APPLICABLE LAW; YOUR USE OF THE COMPANY SERVICES AND/OR THE CONTENT IN VIOLATION OF THIS AGREEMENT; INFORMATION OR CONTENT POSTED OR TRANSMITTED THROUGH YOUR AUTHORIZED DEVICE OR ACCOUNT, EVEN IF NOT SUBMITTED BY YOU, THAT INFRINGES ANY COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, TRADE SECRET, TRADE DRESS, PATENT, PUBLICITY, PRIVACY OR OTHER RIGHT OF ANY PERSON OR ENTITY OR DEFAMES ANY PERSON OR ENTITY; AND ANY MISREPRESENTATION MADE BY YOU. YOU WILL COOPERATE AS FULLY AND AS REASONABLY REQUIRED IN COMPANY'S DEFENSE OF ANY CLAIM. COMPANY RESERVES THE RIGHT, AT ITS OWN EXPENSE, TO ASSUME THE EXCLUSIVE DEFENSE AND CONTROL OF ANY MATTER OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION BY YOU, AND YOU SHALL NOT IN ANY EVENT SETTLE ANY SUCH MATTER WITHOUT THE WRITTEN CONSENT OF COMPANY.\n\nUnsolicited Submissions\n\nCompany does not knowingly accept, via the Company Services or otherwise, unsolicited submissions including, without limitation, submissions by you of blog ideas, articles, scripts, story lines, fan fiction, characters, drawings, information, suggestions, proposals, ideas or concepts.

    "content": "Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., tells 'The Will Cain Show' why he traveled to El Salvador after an alleged MS-13 gang member was deported by the Trump administration.\n\nThe House GOP's elections arm is offering to foot the bill for any future Democratic lawmakers' trips to El Salvador after multiple progressive lawmakers traveled there in protest of the Trump administration's deportation policies.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) made the public offering on Monday – but any takers have to provide real-time video evidence of the visit.\n\n\"If out-of-touch House Democrats are so desperate to cozy up to violent gang members, the least they can do is let Americans watch the show,\" NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella said.\n\n\"We’ll pay for the plane tickets, they just can’t forget to smile for the camera while they sell out their constituents.\"\n\nKILMAR ABREGO GARCIA SUSPECTED OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN REPORT OBTAINED BY FOX NEWS\n\nReps. Maxine Dexter, Robert Garcia and Maxwell A. Frost have traveled to El Salvador. (Getty)\n\nProgressive Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., was in El Salvador last week, where he met with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an illegal immigrant married to an American citizen. The administration says Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 gang member with a violent history.\n\nDemocrats, in contrast, have painted him as a Maryland father and husband wrongfully deported under the Trump administration's sweeping immigration plans.\n\nFour House Democrats – Reps.

    "title": "GOP Rep. Byron Donalds faces shouting, critical questions over DOGE at contentious town hall",
    "content": "GOP Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida faced frequent shouting from the crowd at a contentious town hall on Monday with a number of attendees asking critical questions about the Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe congressman repeatedly asked the crowd to let him speak, saying, “do you want to yell, or do you want to hear?” At another point, he told one attendee that she was being disrespectful for disrupting.\n\nDuring the event, Donalds was asked what oversight he is imposing on Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency as a member of the House Oversight Committee – to loud applause, cheering and whistling.\n\nThe reaction from the crowd was mixed throughout the event as Donalds received applause alongside boos at various points.\n\n“We actually have to let the DOGE actually finish its work. What they are examining right now is inefficiency in the federal system,” the congressman said.\n\nDonalds then began to say that President Barack Obama also wanted to look at inefficiency within the federal government during his time in office, attempting to draw a parallel between that and what Musk is doing – an assertion that prompted loud shouting from the crowd.\n\nThe event comes as relatively few Republicans have held in-person town halls compared to Democratic lawmakers during the current congressional recess period. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have faced frustrated constituents, with Republicans facing criticism over the Trump administration and Democrats facing criticism that the party is not doing enough to counter the administration.\n\nNot long after the first question on DOGE, an attendee asked, “Do you approve of Elon and DOGE invading our Social Security files?” The question led to roaring applause from the crowd.\n\nDonalds began to answer by saying, “Elon Musk and DOGE have been authorized by the president of the United States–-” and was quickly met with loud boos. The congressman attempted to be heard over the shouting. “Don’t boo. No, no, no, no, no. Don’t boo. Don’t boo,” he said.\n\nAs attendees continued to yell and shout, Donalds said, “you don’t want to hear the full story,” adding, ”because you’re not listening.”\n\nThe congressman said, “Now this is my question for the audience: Do you want to yell or do you want to hear?”\n\n“Because if you want to hear, I’m trying to give you the information,” Donalds continued. “I told you, I’m going to be factual. But you can yell or you can hear.”\n\n“If you think it is fine for people to defraud Social Security, you and I don’t agree,” the congressman said. “What the DOGE is doing is they are examining the records, they are providing their findings. Congress has to weigh in on those findings. That’s the way the process works.”\n\nFacing a question about efforts by the Trump administration to cut staff at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the congressman said, “I want you to know that it’s not just the administration that wants to get rid of the CFPB. I want to get rid of the CFPB.” That sparked a mixed response from the crowd – while some applauded, others booed .\n\nStopping to address the audience at one point, Donalds said, “The beauty of a constitutional republic is we get to have these very vigorous debates and disagreements. Here’s what I will tell you, in all my time in elected office and before that, even though I disagree with you, I will respect your opinion. But I will still disagree with you.”\n\nIsrael’s war against Hamas in Gaza also sparked contentious exchanges during the town hall. At one point, a woman in the audience stood up and began shouting in protest of US support for Israel amid the ongoing war in Gaza.\n\nDonalds called the woman disrespectful for disrupting the event. “Like I said, if you want to have a disagreement, let’s have a disagreement. But when you’re going to stand and yell and disrespect everybody in this room because you think you’re being heard. Let us be clear: you’re not,” Donalds said.\n\n“You’re being disrespectful. Ma’am, you are being disrespectful. And I will respect you and I will honor the fact that you are here trying to get answers, but if you are going to hold this thing up and be disrespectful then it’s time for you to be removed.”\n\nA law enforcement officer walked to the edge of the row the woman was standing in, appearing to prompt her to leave. The woman eventually walked out of the row and up the aisle. Chants of “Free Palestine” could be heard as the woman walked away, and Donalds continued to the next question.",

    "title": "Swiss pharmaceuticals company Roche announces $50B investment in US over next 5 years",
    "content": "The logo of the pharmaceutical company Roche pictured in Basel, Switzerland, on Feb. 1, 2017. (Alexandra Wey/Keystone via AP, File)\n\nGENEVA (AP) — Swiss pharmaceuticals powerhouse Roche announced Tuesday it plans to invest $50 billion in the United States over the next five years, creating 12,000 jobs.\n\nThe Basel-based company, whose array of products includes cancer medicines and multiple sclerosis treatment Ocrevus, said the investment would go toward high-tech research and development sites and new manufacturing facilities in places including California, Indiana, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.\n\nSome of the $50 billion in investments were already underway or planned for the next several years, Roche spokesperson Rebekka Schnell said in an e-mail, adding that the company was not specifying how much was announced for the first time on Tuesday.\n\nThe announcement comes as U.S. President Donald Trump has urged foreign businesses to invest more in the United States, and announced sweeping tariffs earlier this month on imports as part of hopes to reduce a large U.S. trade deficit when it comes to sales of goods.\n\nBefore the Trump administration backed off its most stringent tariff plans, products imported from Switzerland had been set to face tariffs of 31% — more than the 20% tariffs on goods from the European Union. Switzerland is not a member of the 27-country bloc but is virtually surrounded by four EU countries.\n\nTrump’s sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs on April 2 set off turmoil in world stock markets. A week later, Trump spoke by phone with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter in a conversation that her office said focused on tariffs. She emphasized the “important role of Swiss companies and investments in the United States.”\n\n\n\nHours later, the U.S. president announced the U-turn that paused the steep new tariffs on about 60 countries for 90 days, fanning speculation — which was not confirmed — in some Swiss media that her chat with Trump might have played a role in the change of course.\n\nRoche, in its statement, said that once the new, expanded manufacturing comes on line, the company “will export more medicines from the U.S. than it imports” — though it made no mention of tariffs.\n\n“Today’s announced investments underscore our longstanding commitment to research, development and manufacturing in the U.S.,” said Roche CEO Thomas Schinecker in a statement.\n\nCompany spokesperson Schnell, in the email, said “we have conducted a thorough analysis of potential scenarios over the last weeks and are well prepared to navigate them, apply mitigation measures and adapt to the changing environment.” She said the investments “have also been aligned with the Swiss government and form part of the ongoing discussions between the U.S. and Switzerland.”\n\nThe company — like cross-town competitor Novartis — has deep ties to the U.S. market and said it currently employs 25,000 people and operates 15 R&D centers and 13 manufacturing sites in the United States.\n\nThe planned investment will add 1,000 jobs at Roche in the U.S. and “more than 11,000 in support of new U.S. manufacturing capabilities,” it said, which will increase its footprint in the United States to 24 sites in eight states.\n\nRoche tallied more than 60 billion Swiss francs (about $74 billion) in worldwide sales last year, and nearly 25 billion francs of sales in its key pharmaceuticals division alone came in the United States. Roche’s share price has fallen by about 18% over the past month, with most of the drop coming after the U.S. tariff announcement on April 2.\n\n",

    "content": "Tesla vehicles line a parking lot at the company’s Fremont, Calif., factory on Sept. 18, 2023. (AP Photo/Noah Berger, file)\n\nTesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk walks to the stage to speak at the Butler Farm Show, Oct. 5, 2024, in Butler, Pa. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, file)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Elon Musk says he’ll be spending less time in Washington slashing government costs and more time running Tesla after his electric vehicle company reported a big drop in profits.\n\nMusk said on a conference call with analysts Tuesday that “now that the major work of establishing Department of Government Efficiency is done,” that he will be “allocating far more of my time to Tesla” starting in May. Musk said he expects to spend “a day or two per week on government matters for as long as the president would like me to do so.”\n\nTesla struggled to sell vehicles as it faced angry protests over Musk’s leadership of DOGE, a jobs-cutting group that has divided the country. The Austin, Texas, company reported a 71% drop in profits and a 9% decline in revenue for the first quarter.\n\n“Investors wanted to see him recommit to Tesla,” said Wedbush Securities’ Dan Ives. “This is a big step in the right direction.”\n\nInvestors sent Tesla shares up more than 5% in after-hours trading, although they are still down more than 40% for the year.\n\nThe company reconfirmed that it expects to roll out a cheaper version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y sport utility vehicle, in the first half of this year. It also stuck with its predictions that it will be able to launch a paid driverless robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June and have much of its fleet operating by itself next year.\n\n“There will be millions of Teslas operating autonomously in the second half of the year,” Musk said in a conference call after the results were announced. He later added about the personal use of autonomous vehicles,“ Can you go to sleep in our cars and wake up at your destination? I’m confident that will be available in many cities in the U.S. by the end of this year.”\n\n\n\nAuto analyst Sam Abuelsamid at Telemetry Insight said he doubts Musk’s predictions.\n\n“The system is not robust enough to operate unsupervised. It still makes far to many errors,” he said. “It will suddenly make mistakes that will lead to a crash.”\n\nThe planned rollout of the robotaxi without a steering wheel or pedals comes as federal regulators still have open investigations into whether the technology that Tesla hopes will allow cars to drive themselves is completely safe.\n\nTesla’s driver-assistance technology that can steer or stop a car but still requires humans to take over at any time — its so-called Autopilot — is being probed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for whether it alerts divers sufficiently when their attention wanders. And the company’s Full Self-Driving, which is only partial self-driving and has drawn criticism for misleading drivers with the name, has come under scrutiny for its tie to accidents in low-visibility conditions like when there is sun glare.\n\nAnother challenge to Tesla, which once dominated the EV business: It is facing fierce competition for the first time.\n\nEarlier this year, Chinese EV maker BYD announced it had developed an electric battery that can charge within minutes. And Tesla’s European rivals have begun offering new models with advanced technology that is making them real Tesla alternatives just as popular opinion has turned against Musk. The Tesla CEO also alienated potential buyers in Europe by publicly supporting far-right politicians there.\n\nTesla said Tuesday that quarterly profits fell by 71% to to $409 million, or 12 cents a share. That’s far below analyst estimates. Tesla’s revenue fell 9% to $19.3 billion in the January through March period, also below Wall Street’s forecast. Tesla’s gross margins, a measure of earnings for each dollar of revenue, fell to 16.3% from 17.4%.\n\nTesla has said it will be hurt less by the Trump administration’s tariffs than most U.S. car companies because it makes most of its U.S. cars domestically. But it won’t be completely unscathed. It sources some materials for its vehicles from abroad that will now face import taxes.\n\nTesla warned in announcing its results that tariffs will hit its energy storage business, too.\n\n“While the current tariff landscape will have a relatively larger impact on our Energy business compared to automotive,” the company said, “we are taking actions to stabilize the business in the medium to long-term and focus on maintaining its health.”\n\nRetaliation from China will also hurt Tesla. The company was forced earlier this month to stop taking orders from mainland customers for two models, its Model S and Model X. It makes the Model Y and Model 3 for the Chinese market at its factory in Shanghai.\n\nThe company’s side business of selling “regulatory credits” to other automakers that fall short of emission standards boosted results for the quarter.\n\nTesla generated $595 million from credit sales, up from $442 million a year ago.\n\nThe company generated $2.2 billion in cash flow versus $242 million a year earlier.\n\nMorningstar analyst Seth Goldstein said earlier reports of plunging sales that had tanked the stock made the quarterly results almost predictable.\n\n“They’re not particularly surprising given that deliveries were down,” he said. “It was good to see positive cash flow.”\n\n",

    "content": "The Supreme Court is seen on Capitol Hill in Washington, Dec. 17, 2024. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — A divided Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that immigrants who agree to leave the country are allowed some deadline flexibility in a case that was argued before President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.\n\nIn a 5-4 decision, the court sided with a man who came from Mexico illegally as a teenager and had lived in Colorado for nearly two decades before he was ordered to leave in 2021. The case was argued in November 2024, days after Trump won re-election. Several other new immigration cases have since come before the court on its emergency docket.\n\nIn the case of Hugo Abisai Monsalvo Velázquez, the Supreme Court majority found that a Saturday deadline to voluntarily leave should have been extended to the following Monday.\n\n“Here, as elsewhere, the term ‘days’ operates to extend a deadline that falls on a weekend or legal holiday to the next business day,” conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in the opinion, which was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts as well as the court’s three liberal justices.\n\nThe other four conservatives disagreed, finding that the justices should have sent the case back to a lower court to decide whether federal courts have jurisdiction over this kind of dispute. Justice Samuel Alito also wrote in a dissent joined by Justice Brett Kavanaugh that the majority’s opinion amounts to an unwarranted two-day extension.\n\n“The Court is sympathetic to petitioner’s plight, but the relevant statutory provision sets a deadline, and no matter how such a deadline is calculated, there will always be those who happen to miss it by a day or so,” Alito wrote.\n\n\n\nMonsalvo Velázquez was born in Mexico and came to the U.S. in 2004, according to court papers. He settled in the Denver area, where he played high school varsity soccer, attended community college and worked for local businesses. He got married, and the couple bought a house and had two children.\n\nHe had recently opened his own auto-detailing service shortly before he was ordered to leave the country in 2021. He was allowed to “self deport,” and an immigration judge set a 60-day deadline to leave that fell on a Saturday.\n\nMonsalvo Velázquez filed a motion to reopen the proceedings late the Friday before the deadline that was docketed the following Monday. It was rejected by the Board of Immigration Appeals and a federal appeals court. Immigrants who do not leave within the required period face removal, fines and ineligibility for most forms of immigration relief for 10 years.\n\n",
