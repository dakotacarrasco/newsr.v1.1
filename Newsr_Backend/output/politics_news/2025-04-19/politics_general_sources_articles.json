They were eager to be part of the performance and proud of what it represented.\n\nAva Moore, 19, watched with her friend, Molly Bowke, 20. “I’m the child of Mexican immigrants, and I don’t always feel connected to American history,” she said, “but the fact that they were willing to stand up to tyranny is very cool.”\n\nSophie Park for The New York Times\n\nJust before 8 p.m., Michael Lepage, playing the role of Revere, emerged from a clapboard house to shouts of “We love you, Paul!” and “You got this, Paul!”\n\nHundreds of people followed Mr. Lepage down Hanover Street. “Oh my God, he’s right there,” a woman gasped.\n\nArriving at the waterfront, Mr. Lepage climbed into a boat to cross the river to Charlestown, where his horse waited.\n\n“What I love is that Revere was just a regular guy,” Joe Hession, 34, said. “You could be a tradesman from the North End, and 250 years later, people are still talking about what you did.”\n\nHow Mark Carney Is Winning Over Quebec in Faltering French\n\nVoters are overlooking Mark Carney’s gaffes and lack of knowledge about the province, viewing him as the most capable candidate to deal with President Trump.\n\n5 min read\n\nWho Will Be Canada’s Next Prime Minister?\n\n4 min read\n\nNew York City’s Hottest Hangout Is a 500-Person Board Game Night\n\nAt Richard Ye’s monthly gatherings, where people play Exploding Kittens, Hues and Cues, and mahjong, New Yorkers find real-life connections and free fun.\n\n5 min read\n\n‘The Rehearsal’ Is an Awkward, Dazzling Ride\n\n2 min read\n\nAn Audacious Novelist, Ahead of Her Time, Gets Her Due\n\n7 min read\n\nThe 50 Best Movies on Netflix Right Now\n\n24 min read\n\nBook Review\n\nA Personal Ad Saved His Father From the Nazis.

Elon Musk, who is slashing the Social Security Administration’s staff, has called it a “Ponzi scheme.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has asserted that Americans aren’t looking at the “day-to-day fluctuations” in their retirement savings.\n\nAnd if automakers raise their prices because of Mr. Trump’s tariffs? “I couldn’t care less,” the president told Kristen Welker of NBC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocrats say the comments show how clueless Mr. Trump and his friends are about the lives of most Americans, and that this is what happens when billionaires run the economy. Republicans counter that highlighting the quotes as unfair cherry picking, and that in the long run everyone will benefit from their policies, even if there’s pain now. Psychologists say that extreme wealth does change people and their views of those who have less.\n\nWhoever is right, it is safe to say that almost no one thinks the comments have been politically helpful for Mr. Trump, or calming for Americans.\n\nSubscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.\n\nElisabeth Bumiller is a writer-at-large for The Times. She was most recently Washington bureau chief. Previously she covered the Pentagon, the White House, the 2008 McCain campaign and City Hall for The Times.\n\nAdvertisement",

We do not endorse, verify or monitor the services / products offered by such Third Party Payment Processors and the contents displayed on the websites of such Third Party Payment Processors.

By signing up for a subscription, you agree to pay us, through the Third Party Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for such subscription in accordance with the applicable payment terms, and you authorize us, through the Third Party Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (for example, a credit or debit card you provide) (your “Payment Method”). You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the Third Party Payment Processor makes even if it has already requested or received payment. Currently, in India, we use BillDesk as our Third Party Payment Processor.\n\n1.4. The Athletic Processing and Payment\n\nThe Athletic may use a third-party payment processor (the “TA Payment Processor”) to bill you through a payment account linked to your account on the Services (your “TA Billing Account”) for your The Athletic subscription fees.

You can access Stripe’s Terms of Service at https://stripe.com/legal/consumer and their Privacy Policy at https://stripe.com/privacy. You can access Braintree’s Services Agreement and Privacy Policy at https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal.\n\nThe terms of your payment will be based on your TA Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer, or other provider of your chosen TA Payment Method. If we, through the TA Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you on time, you agree to pay all amounts due on your TA Billing Account upon demand. If you do not pay us charges you owe us on time (including if any correct charge to your credit or debit card is not authorized), we may suspend or terminate your access to the Services (and we reserve the right to pursue any available legal remedy to collect the amount owed by you). However, charges will continue to be incurred until your subscription is canceled.\n\nReaffirmation of Authorization.

We will notify you of the error and either provide you with a refund or give you the opportunity to cancel your order and obtain a refund if payment has already been made.\n\nAdditional Costs\n\nYour subscription may not include access to all areas of the digital product, and you may have to pay additional fees for full access.

Further details regarding cancellation are included in Section 2 below. As noted below, we may change subscription terms or subscription fees at any time on a go forward basis in our sole discretion.\n\nAfter you have set up an account, you can access information about your subscription period by visiting the Account area of NYTimes.com or contacting our Customer Care group.\n\nIf you redeem a gift subscription, either at that time or prior to the termination of the gift subscription period, you may be presented the option to enter into an automatically renewing subscription that will begin at the end of the term of your gift subscription. You can view your payment method at any time in the Account area of NYTimes.com.\n\nSubscriptions and other purchases through a third party (e.g., Google Play or iOS) are managed directly by the applicable third party. You should consult with the appropriate third party to determine if the price charged includes all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements. You are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges. Those third parties collect one-time and subscription fees, manage the subscription, and report to us on the status of subscription accounts that have been purchased from them. We do not have the ability to initiate, cancel, or refund such a third-party subscription on your behalf, but we do have the ability to make changes to your subscription entitlements in connection with such third-party subscriptions (for example, by turning off your entitlement to a subscription if you canceled it through a third-party).\n\n1.6.2. Billing of One-Time Purchases\n\nWhen you make a one-time purchase through NYTimes (e.g., a subscription sponsorship or standalone product such as an article from our archives or a gift subscription, or Licensed Content), we will charge or debit your payment method at the time of purchase.\n\n1.6.3. Changes to Subscriptions, Products, and Services\n\nWe may change subscription terms or subscription fees at any time on a go forward basis in our sole discretion. If the pricing for your subscription increases, we will notify you and provide you an opportunity to cancel or change your subscription before applying those changes to your account or charging you in connection with an automatic renewal. We may choose in our sole discretion to add, modify, or remove benefits and features from a subscription, product, or service on a temporary or permanent basis. If you do not wish to continue subscribing with the new modifications, you may cancel your subscription. Your failure to cancel or your continued use of any NYTimes product or service after the changes become effective will constitute your acceptance of the changes. If you accept the new subscription, its terms and conditions will apply for that renewal and all renewals going forward.\n\n1.6.4. Family Subscriptions\n\nFamily Subscriptions entitle the paying account holder (the \"Primary Account Holder\"), together with a specified number of subsidiary account holders (each a \"Sub-Account Holder\") to access a Family Subscription, for their own and each Sub-Account Holder's personal use. We may, at our discretion, provide features to the Primary Account Holder that are not available to Sub-Account Holder(s). The Primary Account Holder is responsible for subscription payments and certain notices may be delivered only to the Primary Account Holder.\n\nPlease see the Terms of Service for eligibility restrictions on use of the services, registration, and subscription—the same obligations and limitations apply to both Primary Account Holders and Sub-Account Holders.\n\nPrimary Account Holders must not share the Family Subscription with another individual without that individual’s permission. Primary Account Holders maintain the ability to remove Sub-Account Holders without notice to or consent from the Sub-Account Holder. Promotions available to Sub-Account Holders or others may not be available to the Primary Account Holder.\n\nIf the Primary Account Holder cancels a Family Subscription, or the account or subscription is otherwise suspended or terminated, the Primary Account Holder and Sub-Account Holder(s) will lose access to their subscriptions as outlined in Section 2. Sub-Account Holders are not eligible to manage or cancel Family Subscriptions. We reserve the right to terminate or suspend access to a Family Subscription immediately and at any time if you abuse the subscription or violate these Terms of Sale or our Terms of Service.\n\nFamily Subscriptions can only be shared with users who do not have an existing New York Times subscription. Primary Account Holders are not able to add active New York Times subscribers to a Family Subscription until that user cancels their current plan and their subscription period ends. If you have an existing individual New York Times subscription and you join a Family Subscription as a Sub-Account Holder using different account credentials from those used for your existing subscription, you are responsible for cancelling your existing subscription.\n\n1.7. Unpaid Charges\n\nIf any fee is not paid in a timely manner, or your transaction cannot be processed, we reserve the right to suspend, disable, cancel or terminate your access to the product or services or cancel your subscription.\n\nIf your credit card expires or your payment method is otherwise invalid, we do not automatically terminate your account and you will remain responsible for all charges and uncollected amounts incurred until you cancel pursuant to Section 2.1 or we, in our sole discretion, decide to terminate your account.\n\nIn addition, we reserve the right to collect from you all costs we incur in connection with the collection of unpaid amounts, including court costs, attorneys' fees, collection agency fees and any other associated costs.\n\n1.8. Promotions\n\nWe may offer promotions. The specific terms of each promotion are stated at the time the promotion is offered. Each promotion may be different. Promotions cannot be combined.\n\nWe may offer promotional trial subscriptions to allow access to the products or services on a trial basis or at a promotional rate.\n\nIf your subscription includes a free trial, you will not be charged the applicable fee during your free trial. To obtain the free trial, you are required to provide your payment details when you sign up in order to ensure uninterrupted access and continued use after the expiration of the free trial. Upon completion of your free trial, your subscription will automatically convert into a paid subscription and your payment method will be charged the applicable fee unless you have canceled your subscription in accordance with Section 2.1. You may cancel your subscription during your free trial to avoid being charged as described above and below; such cancellation will be effective immediately.\n\nIf your subscription includes a promotional rate, you will be charged the promotional rate for the relevant number of subscription periods and upon completion of that period, your subscription will continue to automatically renew at the full rate. To avoid being charged the full rate, you must cancel in accordance with Section 2.1 before the promotional period ends.\n\nYou may only be permitted to use one free trial or promotional rate offer. If your subscription is ever canceled or terminated for any reason and you purchase an additional subscription, you may not be eligible for a free trial or another promotional rate offer.\n\nPlease note that we do not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price drop or promotional offering.\n\nWe may offer promotional pricing or credits to new or existing subscribers and for other marketing purposes, such as a referral program (“Referral Program”). Eligible users may be able to earn benefits (like discounts or credits) by inviting their eligible friends and family as new customers, or subscribing to a new, eligible NYTimes subscription. New users may be able to purchase a subscription at a discount through the Referral Program. Your ability to earn, use, and take advantage of such benefits and discounts is subject to applicable terms and instructions. You must be truthful and accurate in your participation in the Referral Program. Each apparent referral is subject to independent verification by us. Benefits earned through the Referral Program must be used by the intended audience for the intended purposes and may not be sold or transferred in any manner or made available to the general public (whether posted to a public forum or otherwise), unless expressly permitted by NYTimes. Except as permitted by NYTimes, such benefits are non-transferrable, may not be resold, and are not redeemable for cash or other consideration. Benefits earned through the Referral Program may not be used in conjunction with select promotions. You agree we may change the terms and conditions of the Referral Program, terminate the Referral Program, or withhold, expire, deduct, limit, invalidate, or modify your benefits at any time for any reason, including, but not limited to, in the event that NYTimes determines or believes that your participation in the Referral Program or use or redemption of benefits was in error, or was fraudulent, illegal, or otherwise in violation or circumvention of these Terms of Sale, our Terms of Service, or any other policies or requirements posted by us in relation to the Referral Program (including, but not limited to, providing incomplete or untruthful information, attempts to refer “dummy” email accounts, attempting to register the same individual under different names or email addresses, or completing registration information on behalf of others). NYTimes will have the final decision in any disputes over your participation in the Referral Program.\n\nThe Athletic may separately offer discounted subscriptions from time to time subject to the terms under which they are offered (as indicated in our relevant promotion). Unless otherwise noted, the promotional subscription fee pricing is available for the first year, after which The Athletic’s regular subscription fee pricing will apply. Any free trial or other promotion that provides access to a subscription must be used within the specified time of the trial. You must cancel your subscription before the end of the trial period in order to avoid being charged for that subscription. If you cancel prior to the end of the trial period and are inadvertently charged for a subscription, please contact us at nytimes.com/athletic/contact-support.\n\n1.9. Software Products\n\nIf you purchase a digital subscription that includes downloadable software, your download and use of that software may be subject to different or additional terms or end user license agreements.\n\n1.10. Licensed Content\n\nLicensed Content is licensed, not sold, to you by the NYTimes. After completing a transaction for Licensed Content (e.g., Puzzle Packs) we grant you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to access the selected Licensed Content for personal, non-commercial use in accordance with these Terms of Sale, the Terms of Service, and any additional terms that may be presented as you complete the transaction. Your license to Licensed Content has no cash value, cannot be exchanged for real money, real goods, or real services. If you close your account, you will lose access to the Licensed Content associated with your account and will not receive a refund or other value for such Licensed Content unless required by law. All rights and title in Licensed Content not expressly granted to you are reserved. If you violate any applicable terms, your rights to the Licensed Content will immediately terminate, and we may take other action. We reserve the right to change, remove, revoke, limit, or modify any Licensed Content at any time without any liability to you.\n\n1.11. Third Parties\n\nIf you have purchased your product through a third party (such as Google Play or iOS), these Terms of Sale may not apply to you. In that event, your contract for such products will be with the third party and not with us. We are not liable to you for any claims related to purchases made through third parties. Please contact the third party directly.\n\n1.12. Electronic Notifications\n\nYou consent to receive notifications from us or from The Athletic electronically to the email address you provide to us. You agree that all notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing, or be delivered in a particular manner. You agree that you have the ability to store such electronic communications such that they remain accessible to you in an unchanged form.\n\n1.13. Severability\n\nIf any section of these Terms of Sale is deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that section will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining sections.\n\n1.14. Entire Agreement\n\nThe Terms of Sale, the Terms of Service, and any other special terms constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and NYTimes and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral.\n\n_____\n\n2. CANCELLATION AND REFUND POLICY\n\n2.1. Cancellation and Refunds of Subscriptions\n\nWhen you cancel a subscription, you cancel only future charges associated with your subscription. You may initiate your cancellation at any time, but the cancellation will become effective at the end of your current billing period. Please note that canceling your New York Times subscription does not automatically cancel your subscription to The Athletic. You can cancel your subscription to The Athletic at any time on your The Athletic account page or by contacting customer support.In order to avoid future charges, you must cancel your subscription prior to the end of your current subscription period (which you can find in your Subscription Overview within the Account area of NYTimes.com or, for your subscription to The Athletic, in your The Athletic account settings page). If you cancel prior to the deadline, you will not be charged or you will be eligible to receive a refund for additional charges. For subscriptions that are canceled within a free trial period, your cancellation will become effective immediately; for all other subscriptions your cancellation will become effective at the end of your current subscription period, and you will continue to have access to your subscription for the remainder of the subscription period. Subscribers are given various cancellation options. These methods of cancellation are subject to change. Once your subscription has been canceled, you will have limited access to NYTimes’s content. We explain each of these methods of cancellation below. You can also find these cancellation methods described in our “Cancel Your Subscription” help desk article or in The Athletic's help desk article.\n\nCall us at 866-273-3612 if you are in the U.S. Our hours are 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. E.T. Monday to Friday, and 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. E.T. on weekends and holidays.\n\nIf you are outside the U.S, please see our international contact information.\n\nSelect the “Chat” button on the Cancel Your Subscription help desk article to chat with a Care Advocate and cancel your subscription.\n\nChat is accessible from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. E.T. seven days a week.\n\nAll digital subscriptions billed through NYTimes can be canceled using your account. This option is also available for certain Home Delivery subscriptions. Digital subscriptions to The Athletic may be billed separately and must be canceled separately. To cancel your subscription to The Athletic, please go through your The Athletic account settings page or this help link.\n\nAs noted above, if you purchased your subscription through a third-party (such as Google Play or iOS), you will need to contact the third-party directly to cancel or make changes to your subscription.\n\nIf you cancel your monthly combined print and digital subscription, you will only be charged for the number of copies of the Home Delivery you have received and your digital access to NYTimes digital products will end upon cancellation. In the case of International Edition Home Delivery, your monthly combined print and digital subscription may be billed and charged in arrears based on the number of copies you have received in the ending subscription period.\n\nIf you cancel your non-monthly combined print and digital subscription—which may have required a commitment for a certain period of time (e.g., quarter, semester, or year) and payment in advance—we will refund you the pro-rata prepaid amount of unserved copies of the print subscription, and your cancellation of the digital products will become effective immediately.\n\nIf you subscribe to multiple products or services, such as both The Athletic and NYTimes, your cancellation of one product or service may not result in the cancellation of all products or services.\n\nIf you purchased your subscription through a third party (such as Google Play or iOS), you will need to use the third-party platform or contact the third party directly to cancel or make changes to your subscription.\n\nEXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED IN THESE TERMS OF SALE OR AS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION FEE IS NONREFUNDABLE. If you cancel your subscription, you are not entitled to receive any refund or credits for the time remaining in your subscription period. Except as otherwise stated in these Terms of Sale or as required by applicable law, you will continue to have the same access and benefits of your subscription for the remainder of the current subscription period.\n\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion. If we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\n\nCertain products sold as part of a promotion, subject to an annual commitment, or as an add-on to your Home Delivery subscription may have different cancellation or refund policies that will be made clear at the time of purchase or otherwise before they become effective.\n\n2.2. Suspensions or Cancellations by Us\n\nWithout limiting any other remedies, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your subscription or product or portion thereof for any reason, with or without notice and without further obligation. If we cancel your subscription, we may give you a pro-rated refund based on the amount of time remaining that you cannot use. However, we will not be obligated to grant you a refund if we terminate your subscription because we determine, in our sole discretion, that your actions or your use of the products or services violate these Terms of Sale or our Terms of Service (including, if applicable, the Crossplay Acceptable Use Policy), any applicable law, or has harmed the service, product, or another user. If any or all of our digital products are temporarily unavailable, you will not receive a refund. We reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\n\n2.3. Changing Your Subscription\n\nWhen you change your subscription, you may receive a pro-rated credit for fees paid in advance for your prior subscription that will be used toward your new subscription, at our sole discretion.\n\n2.4. Pro-Rated Credits\n\nIf you cancel your subscription prior to using all of the pro-rated credit, then you may no longer have access to any unused portion of that credit.\n\n2.5. Cancellation and Refunds of One-Time Purchases\n\nUnless specified otherwise in these Terms of Sale, one-time purchases cannot be canceled or refunded. For more information on the cancellation terms for gift subscriptions, see the Gift Subscriptions FAQ.\n\nIf we issue a discretionary refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\n\n_____\n\n3. CHANGES TO THESE TERMS OF SALE\n\nWe may, from time to time, change these Terms of Sale. When such changes are made, we will make a copy of the new Terms of Sale available to you on our website. If you do not cancel the services after the changes become effective, you agree to the changed terms.\n\n_____\n\n4. ADDITIONAL TERMS OF SALE FOR USERS IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS\n\nTo the extent this Section 4 is in conflict or inconsistent with other provisions contained in these Terms of Sale, this Section 4 governs.\n\nAll parts of these Terms of Sale and the Terms of Service apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. However, you may have greater rights in your jurisdiction of residence. If, in any jurisdiction, any provision of these Terms of Sale and the Terms of Service or their application to any party or circumstance is restricted, prohibited, or unenforceable, that provision will, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the extent of the restriction, prohibition, or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of these Terms of Sale and the Terms of Service and without affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction or affecting its application to other parties or circumstances.\n\nCertain users may have a legal right to cancel their subscription and obtain a refund. The extent of this legal right depends on the laws in the jurisdiction where you reside and the type of subscription you purchased.\n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms of Sale or the Terms of Service:\n\n4.1. Residents of the European Union and United Kingdom\n\n4.1.1. Right to Withdraw\n\nYou have a right to withdraw from subscriptions within a certain time frame based on whether your subscription is for digital products only or for combined print and digital products. These time frames are set forth below. Upon cancellation during the applicable time frame, NYTimes will provide a full refund of payments received from you in relation to the subscription being canceled. No payment will be returned to you if you cancel during a free trial period before you have been charged.\n\nYou may cancel your subscription by contacting our Customer Care group or mailing the cancellation form provided here addressed to: The New York Times Company, Attn: Subscriptions/Cancellations, 8 Bloomsbury Street, London, WC1B 3SR, United Kingdom.\n\nSubscriptions for Digital Products Only\n\nYou have a right to withdraw from subscriptions for digital products within fourteen (14) days of the date on which you start (or the recipient of a gift subscription starts) the initial subscription term. You agree at the time of purchase that NYTimes may immediately provide you with the digital product and that you lose your right to withdraw for a full refund. Your cancellation of the digital products will become effective immediately.\n\nSubscriptions for Combined Print and Digital Products\n\nYou have a right to withdraw from subscriptions for combined print and digital products within fourteen (14) days of the date on which you receive (or the recipient of a gift subscription receives) the first issue of a print product. If you cancel, you do not need to return to us any print product you have already received. Upon cancellation, you will no longer receive print products from NYTimes (unless you re-subscribe), and your cancellation of the digital products will become effective immediately.\n\n4.1.2. Limitation of Liability for Residents of Germany\n\nAny liability of NYTimes, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies, as well as its and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents (the “Released Parties”) irrespective of its legal basis is limited to cases of intent or gross negligence. In cases of slight negligence, the Released Parties are only liable if essential contractual obligations are breached. Essential contractual obligations are obligations, the violation of which endangers the achievement of the purpose of the contract or the fulfillment of which enables the proper execution of the contract in the first place and which you regularly trust to be observed. In this case, the liability is limited to damages which are typical and foreseeable. The Released Parties are not liable for the slightly negligent breach of obligations other than those mentioned in the preceding sentences. The above limitations of liability do not apply in the case of personal injury or death. Liability under the German Product Liability Act remains unaffected.\n\n4.2. Residents of Canada\n\n4.2.1. Changes to Terms of Sale\n\nSection 3 above is amended to replace “[w]hen such changes are made, we will make a copy of the new Terms of Sale available to you on our website.” with the following: “If you do not cancel the services after the changes become effective, you agree to the changed terms. Any such amendment will be effective thirty (30) days following the dispatch of a notice to you by any contact method we have for you, such as the email address you have registered for your account, in addition we will post the amendment on the NYTimes website or App and, where required by law, the notice will set out the new section, or the modified section and how it read formerly, and the date on which the change will come into effect. Where required by applicable law we will also include an opportunity for you to acknowledge your agreement and acceptance of any such amendment to the Terms of Sale. Unless you have provided your consent to the amendment, if the amendment entails an increase to your obligations or a reduction of our obligations, you may refuse the amendment and terminate the contract without cost, penalty or cancellation indemnity by sending us a notice to that effect no later than 30 days after the amendment comes into force.”\n\n4.2.2. Place of the Contract\n\nDigital and print products will be provided at the address provided during the purchase process. For residents of all provinces and territories other than Quebec, the law of the province in which you reside will apply to the Terms of Sale and Terms of Service.\n\n4.2.3. Right to Cancel for Québec Residents\n\nYou have a right to obtain a pro-rata refund when you cancel your subscription during the middle of a billing period. Your right to a refund is subject to NYTimes’ right to charge you a cancellation fee of up to 10% of the pro-rata amount for the remaining portion of your billing period. In no event may this cancellation fee exceed CAD $50.\n\n4.3. Residents of Australia\n\nSections 4.3.1 through 4.3.9 below relate to the Terms of Sale\n\n4.3.1. Disclaimer of Warranties\n\nTO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND SUBJECT TO ANY NON-EXCLUDABLE RIGHT OR REMEDY:\n\n4.3.2. Consumer Guarantees and Obligations Imposed on NYTimes; Limitation of Liability\n\nCertain legislation in Australia provides consumer guarantees or imposes obligations on NYTimes that cannot be excluded, restricted or modified, or only to a limited extent. In particular, if you buy goods or services from NYTimes as a consumer, the goods or services come with consumer guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law (Schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010) which cannot be excluded, restricted or modified. These Terms of Sale are subject to such legislation.\n\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, and subject to any such non-excludable right or remedy, NYTimes is not liable to you for any loss or damage incurred by you in connection with your subscription, whether direct, consequential, special, indirect, or other loss or damage except to the extent such loss or damage is caused by the act or omission of NYTimes. To the extent permitted by applicable law, NYTimes’ maximum liability to you is limited to the value of the subscription fees paid within the previous twelve months.\n\nExcept as provided in this Section 4.3, the limitations of NYTimes’ liability described in the Terms of Service apply.\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in these Terms, our Terms of Service, or the special terms, NYTimes is not willing and not obligated to participate in dispute resolution procedures before bodies responsible for out-of-court settlement of consumer disputes.\n\n4.3.3. Goods and Services Tax\n\nUnless otherwise stated, charges referred to for any goods or services supplied (or offered for supply) includes any GST that NYTimes is required to pay on the supply of goods and services to you. GST means the Goods and Services Tax levied in Australia under A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth).\n\n4.3.4. How NYTimes may exercise its rights and discretions\n\nA reference to our 'sole discretion' under these Terms shall be interpreted as a reference to our 'discretion, acting reasonably'.\n\n4.3.5.

We will give you reasonable notice (of at least 30 days) if we do so and provide you an opportunity to cancel or change your subscription before applying those changes to your subscription, product or service.\n\n4.3.6. Promotions\n\nUnder Section 1.8 (Promotions) of the Terms of Sale:\n\n(a) If your subscription includes a free trial, we will give you reasonable notice before the free trial ends to give you an opportunity to cancel your subscription before the paid subscription commences.\n\n(b) If your subscription includes a promotional rate, we will give you reasonable notice before the promotional period ends to give you the opportunity to cancel your subscription before applying the full rate.\n\n(c) In relation to Referral Programs, if we (acting reasonably) make a determination in any disputes over your participation in the Referral Program, this does not prevent you from disputing in good faith any determination or decision made by NYTimes.\n\n4.3.7. Third Parties\n\nUnder Section 1.9 (Third Parties) of the Terms of Sale, we will not be liable to you for any claims related to purchases made through third parties, except to the extent of our fraud, negligence or misconduct.\n\n4.3.8. Entire Agreement clause\n\nSection 1.14 (Entire Agreement) of these Terms of Sale is deleted.\n\n4.3.9. Changes to these Terms of Sale\n\nIf we make changes in accordance with Section 3 (Changes to these Terms of Sale) of the Terms of Sale, we will tell you about the changes as soon as reasonably possible. If we reasonably believe a change is unfavourable to you, we will give you prior notice of at least 30 days before any change takes effect.\n\n4.3.10. Modifications to The Terms of Service for Australia Residents\n\nA reference to our 'sole discretion' in the Terms of Service shall be interpreted as a reference to our 'discretion, acting reasonably'.\n\nUnder Section 5.1 (Representation and warranties; Indemnification; Limitations of Liabilities) of the Terms of Service, you do not have to indemnify and hold harmless NYTimes or any Indemnified Parties to the extent any fraud, negligence or misconduct by NYTimes or any Indemnified Party contributed to the liability and costs.\n\nSection 5.2 of the Terms of Service is amended by deleting the words: 'OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE'.\n\n4.4. Residents of India\n\n4.3.1. Disclaimer of Warranties\n\nTO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND SUBJECT TO ANY NON-EXCLUDABLE RIGHT OR REMEDY:\n\n4.4.2. Limitation of Liability\n\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, and subject to any such non-excludable right or remedy, NYTimes (including its officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, partners, service providers or affiliates) is not liable to you for any loss or damage incurred by you in connection with your subscription, whether direct, consequential, special, indirect, incidental, reliance or other loss or damage except to the extent such loss or damage is caused by the act or omission of NYTimes. To the extent permitted by applicable law, NYTimes’ maximum liability to you is limited to the value of the subscription fees paid within the previous twelve months.\n\nExcept as provided in this Section 4.4, the limitations of NYTimes’ liability described in the Terms of Service apply.\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in these Terms, our Terms of Service, or the special terms, NYTimes is not willing and not obligated to participate in dispute resolution procedures before bodies responsible for out-of-court settlement of consumer disputes.\n\n4.4.3. Reliance\n\nYou acknowledge and agree to the Disclaimers of Warranties and the Limitation of Liability set forth in Section 4.4.1 and 4.4.2 above while accepting these Terms. You further agree that the Disclaimers of Warranties and the Limitation of Liability, set forth in Section 4.4.1 and 4.4.2 above, reflect a reasonable and fair allocation of risk between you and NYTimes, and that such Disclaimers of Warranties and the Limitation of Liability form an essential basis of the agreement between you and NYTimes.\n\n4.4.4. Promotions\n\nUnder Section 1.8 (Promotions) of the Terms of Sale:\n\n(a) If your subscription includes a free trial, we will give you reasonable notice before the free trial ends to give you an opportunity to cancel your subscription before the paid subscription commences.\n\n(b) If your subscription includes a promotional rate, we will give you reasonable notice before the promotional period ends to give you the opportunity to cancel your subscription before applying the full rate.\n\n(c) In relation to Referral Programs, if we (acting reasonably) make a determination in any disputes over your participation in the Referral Program, this does not prevent you from disputing in good faith any determination or decision made by NYTimes.",

    "content": "Trump Administration\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an open letter, prominent Republicans criticized President Trump for using his power to punish two former administration officials who criticized him.\n\nBy Karoun Demirjian\n\nA number of prominent Republicans, including several former members of the first Trump administration, have signed an open letter decrying the president for using his power to punish two former administration officials who criticized him, likening his actions to those of a “royal despot.”\n\n“For a president to personally and publicly direct the levers of the federal government against publicly named citizens for political reasons sets a new and perilous precedent in our republic,” the group wrote. “No matter one’s party or politics, every American should reject the notion that the awesome power of the presidency can be used to pursue individual vendettas.”\n\nEarlier this month, Mr. Trump issued two executive orders revoking the security clearances of Chris Krebs, who led the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency under during Mr. Trump’s first term and rebutted his claims that the 2020 election had been rigged and stolen, and Miles Taylor, who once served as chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security. Mr. Taylor anonymously wrote a New York Times opinion essay in 2018 accusing Mr. Trump of rampant “amorality” and telling of an internal government “resistance.”\n\nSubscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.\n\nKaroun Demirjian is a breaking news reporter for The Times.\n\nAdvertisement",

    "content": "Advertisement\n\nMore than 700 events were planned for Saturday, as people turned out to speak against the administration’s handling of immigration, civil liberties and federal job cuts.\n\nBy Jesus Jiménez and Minho Kim\n\nProtesters across the country on Saturday began taking to the streets to demonstrate against President Trump’s leadership and agenda, just two weeks after mass demonstrations were held in cities and towns nationwide against the new administration.\n\nMore than 700 events were planned on Saturday, from New York City to Jacksonville, Fla., to Los Angeles, according to the organizer, the group 50501, which said it was seeking to defend civil liberties and fight against what it said were authoritarian actions of the Trump administration.\n\nAlthough many of the events were traditional protests, many also were intended to unite local communities through activities such as food drives. Mass protests during President Trump’s first term, like the Women’s March, often focused on a single topic, but demonstrators on Saturday expressed outrage on a wide range of issues.\n\nSubscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.\n\nJesus Jiménez is a Times reporter covering Southern California.\n\nMinho Kim covers breaking news and climate change for The Times.
