    "title": "Rory McIlroy wins Masters playoff to complete the career Grand Slam",
    "content": "McIlroy wins 2025 Masters in a play-off to complete careeer grand slam\nEstimated read time: 6-7 minutes\nAUGUSTA, Ga. — The closer Rory McIlroy came to fulfilling his lifetime dream — winning the Masters — the more it kept slipping away. Sunday at Augusta National felt like his last 11 years in the majors, blunders mixed in with sheer brilliance.\nA two-shot lead gone in two holes. A four-shot lead gone in three holes with a shocker of a mistake. A 5-foot putt on the final hole to win narrowly missed.\nAnd then McIlroy turned what could have been another major collapse into his grandest moment of all when he hit wedge to 3 feet for birdie in a sudden-death playoff against Justin Rose to become — finally — a Masters champion and take his place in golf history as the sixth player with the career Grand Slam.\n\"There were points in my career where I didn't know if I would have this nice garment over my shoulders,\" McIlroy said, that Masters green jacket looking like a perfect fit. \"But I didn't make it easy today. I certainly didn't make it easy. I was nervous.\n\"It was one of the toughest days I've ever had on the golf course.\"\nThe reward was greater than he imagined, and it showed. He rapped in that final putt, raised both arms in the air and let the putter fall behind him. He covered his head, dropped to his knees, and before long his forehead was on the green as his chest heaved with emotion.\nThat was 11 years of pent-up emotion from his last major, when he began to carry the burden of getting the final leg of the Grand Slam. It was 14 years of remembering the time he wasted a four-shot lead with an 80 on the final day as a 21-year-old.\n\"I started to wonder if it would ever be my time,\" he said.\nThe thought could have easily crossed his mind during the final round.\nWhat could have been a coronation for McIlroy along the back nine turned into a heart-racing, lead-changing, jaw-dropping finish at golf's greatest theater that ended with McIlroy sobbing with joy and disbelief.\nIt ended with more heartache for Rose, who lost to Sergio Garcia in a playoff in 2017 and forced this one with a clutch 20-foot birdie on the 18th hole for a 6-under 66. He wound up joining Ben Hogan as the only players to lose twice in playoffs at Augusta National.\n\"It's the kind of putt you dream about as a kid, and to have it and hole it, it was a special feeling,\" Rose said. \"And unfortunately, the playoff, they always end so quickly. If you're not the guy to hit the great shot or hole the great putt, it's over. But not really anything I could have done more today.\"\nThe joy on McIlroy's face never left him from the time that putt dropped — on the green, in Butler Cabin when defending champion Scottie Scheffler first helped him into the green jacket, and during the trophy presentation on the 18th green.\n\"My dreams have been made today,\" McIlroy said.\nMoments later, speaking to 4-year-old daughter Poppy, he told her: \"Never give up on your dreams. Never, ever give up on your dreams.\"\nThis was shaping up as another horror show for McIlroy, who in 2011 lost a four-shot lead on the final day with a 43 on the back nine, a highlight reel that now can start collecting dust.\n\"I didn't make it easy today,\" McIlroy said.\nRight when it looked as though he would throw away another major, McIlroy delivered two majestic shots when nothing less would do, two birdies that sent him to the 18th hole with a one-shot lead.\nThat still wasn't enough. He hit a wedge into the bunker and wound up missing a 5-foot par putt for a 1-over 73 and the first Masters playoff in eight years.\nFaced with more failure, McIlroy responded with another booming drive, and this wedge bounced onto the slope of the top shelf with enough spin to trickle down toward the hole, closer and closer, until it stopped 3 feet away.\nAnd when Rose missed from 15 feet, McIlroy finally sealed it.\n\"I just think all week how I responded to setbacks, that's what I'll take from this week,\" McIlroy said, though he could have been speaking for the last decade. \"Couldn't be more proud I myself for that and being able to back bounce when I needed to.\"\nMcIlroy went 11 long years without any major, knowing the Masters green jacket was all that kept him from joining Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Ben Hogan and Gene Sarazen as the only winners of golf's four professional majors.\nNicklaus and Player spoke on Thursday how they thought this was his time. Woods was among those to congratulate McIlroy and welcome him to the club.\nSo wild was this Sunday at Augusta National that McIlroy set a Masters record as the first champion to make four double bogeys — two in the first round that put him seven shots behind, two in the final round that turned this into a thriller.\nU.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who beat McIlroy at Pinehurst No. 2 last June, had the lead after two holes when McIlroy opened with a double bogey. DeChambeau crashed out with a pair of three-putts and two shots into the water on the back nine, closing with a 75.\nLudvig Aberg, a runner-up in his Masters debut a year ago, suddenly had a share of the lead when McIlroy fell apart on the middle of the back nine. He missed a birdie putt from the fringe to take the lead, then finished bogey-triple bogey.\nMcIlroy and Rose finished at 11-under 277, two shots ahead of former Masters champion Patrick Reed (69). Scheffler, trying to win the Masters for the third time in four years, never got anything going this week and still shot 69 to finish fourth.\nRose had every reason to believe he threw away his chances on Saturday with a 75 that put him seven shots behind, and then two bogeys on the front nine. Even as he steadied himself, he was four shots back and running out of time.\nHe did his part in a 10-birdie round and that dynamic birdie putt to cap it off.\nMcIlroy did his part, too.\nNothing was more shocking than the 13th. McIlroy played it safe, leaving himself a big target from 82 yards away and a lob wedge. He missed his mark by some 20 yards, the ball disappearing into the tributary of Rae's Creek and leading to double bogey.\nRose was on the par-3 16th and hit his tee shot to 4 feet for birdie, and suddenly they were tied. Then, McIlroy hit a weak drive to the right and was blocked by pines. He didn't reach the green, didn't make the par putt and no longer had the lead.\nBut he was resilient as ever — he's been like that his entire career. Seemingly in trouble left of the 15th fairway, McIlroy hit 7-iron around the trees and onto the green to 6 feet.\nHe missed the eagle putt — the birdie still helped him regain a share of the lead. Two holes later, facing a semi-blind shot, he drilled 8-iron and chased after it, urging it to \"Go! Go! Go! Go!\" And it did, barely clearing the bunker and rolling out to 2 feet for birdie and a one-shot lead.\nTurns out that wasn't enough, either. He was 5 feet away from victory and badly missed the putt, leaving him more work to do — another chance to fail.\nNot this time. The 35-year-old from Northern Ireland never wavered in what he came to Augusta National to do. He leaves with a green jacket.\nMost recent Golf stories\nAfter a wayward Sunday at the Masters, Bryson DeChambeau is 'super excited' about tweaking his gear\nJustin Rose played a memorable round at the Masters.

    "content": "Apparently, the presence of a dozing dog gets a parade going. (ViralHog via YouTube)\nEstimated read time: 2-3 minutes\nTHE NEIGHBORHOOD – I'm going to go out on a limb and proclaim that when it comes to old sayings, there are more about dogs than any other single thing. Consider just a handful of examples:\nCan't teach a dog new tricks.\nTail wagging the dog.\nAll bark and no bite.\nBarking up the wrong tree.\nEvery dog has its day.\nLet sleeping dogs lie.\nI couldn't help but notice how many of these idioms refer to lounging around and sleeping. There's something about a dozing dog that really gets the creativity flowing.\nApparently, the presence of a dozing dog also gets a parade going. Check out this delightful video from Ayacucho, Peru:\nWhat exactly is going on here? All I know is that it looks like a really fun party.\n\"My dog rehearsed a whole month for this,\" explains the caption written by the user who posted the video. \"The video was filmed with the protagonists of the Legendarios Morochucos comparsa, who surround the dog when he pretends to be asleep, showing his tiredness. … Where the dog lovingly lies down and does not get up, despite the crowd of people, and the reaction of the comparsa artists was to surround him to fill him with allegories among the sound of tinyas, guitars and quenas.\"\nAmazing. Seems like this dog stunt could really liven up some of the parades we have around my area. The only problem would be discerning between a dog that has rehearsed its napping for the parade and a dog that is legitimately just trying to catch a quick 40 winks.\nDoes this drone ring a bell?\nBetter luck next time, drone pilot.

Gardner Policy Institute shows the Beehive State's median household income ranks high compared with other states, with Utah middle-income households earning more on average than middle-income households in other states.\n\"Consistent with high GDP, personal income is often another measure to look at economic growth,\" said Natalie Roney, a research economist at the Gardner Institute.\nWhen adjusting for localized cost-of-living differences between states, Utah's median household income — of upwards of $98,000 — ranks highest in the country, nearly 27% higher than the U.S. average.\nThere are a few reasons why this is the case, Roney said.\nContributing to Utah's top-ranking median household income is the state's large household size and a high number of individuals in the workforce per household, according to the report.\nRoney said in the post-COVID years, Utah has seen large jumps in personal income.\nA chart showing Utah's median household income from 2000 to 2023 is pictured. A new report from the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute shows the Beehive State's median household income ranks high compared with other states, with middle-income households earning more on average that middle-income households in other states. (Photo: Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute)\nAnd while Utah's cost of living has increased, it's still lower than the national average.\n\"Not really surprising, Summit County is the only county in Utah that has a cost of living that does surpass the U.S. average and we do see higher cost of living in more urban areas along the Wasatch Front and down in Washington County,\" Roney said.\nStill, you might be wondering where Utah's housing market fits into the conversation.\nA March poll revealed the price of housing is causing a significant number of Utahns to think about leaving the state for someplace more affordable.\nEven though a majority of Utahns, 56%, say housing is too expensive, they aren't going anywhere. A third agreed with the statement, \"Housing is so expensive that I've considered moving out of state.\"\nRoney said Utah's median household income still ranks so high simply because 70% of Utah households have already purchased homes, meaning their budgets are not directly impacted by higher housing costs.\n\"For the most part, it's renters and new buyers that are facing the really high prices, where somebody that bought their home 10 years ago or 20 years ago, their housing prices are much more manageable than those that have recently bought or maybe have seen big rent increases in recent years,\" said Phil Dean, chief economist at the Gardner Institute. \"It's kind of looking at that average Utahn rather than the marginal home buyer.\"\nThe Key Takeaways for this article were generated with the assistance of large language models and reviewed by our editorial team.

    "content": "Springville resident Kayla Meehan hikes Mount Timpanogos in September 2024. Meehan has found hiking helps her connect with nature and contributes to mental wellness. (Kayla Meehan)\nEstimated read time: 5-6 minutes\nLocal hikers find mental wellness in Utah mountains amid technology and stress.\nKayla Meehan and Tennison Hunter highlight hiking's mental health benefits and community.\nTimpanogos Hiking Co. promotes wellness with hiking challenges like the GOAT and Escape the Noise.\nPROVO — In an era of unprecedented technology and mental health crises, local hikers are finding solace in the mountains.\nSpringville resident Kayla Meehan found herself needing to get outside during the COVID-19 pandemic while stuck working from home. So she decided to start hiking the Wasatch Mountains, which she grew up next to but never took the time to explore.\n\"I really felt confined. Just being outside opened up the opportunity to feel like myself again,\" she said. \"After 2020, I have not been able to stay out of the mountains. It's been a consistent addiction. It's more of like a passion that I did not expect to be one of my hobbies.\"\nIt's easy to get caught up in work, family, and all the day-to-day tasks, where notifications are constantly buzzing in your pocket, she said.\n\"Being able to go into the mountains and have them close is so nice. We can just unplug literally and escape the noise of everyday life. Taking a break and not having your notifications go off, whether it's important or not, it can wait because your mental health comes first,\" she said.\nMeehan first connected with local business Timpanogos Hiking Co. last year while filming a commercial that included hiking. Timpanogos Hiking Co. has a motto to \"escape the noise\" and promotes mental and physical wellness through hiking and outdoor recreation.\nSpringville resident Kayla Meehan hikes Bald Mountain in Park City overlooking Jordanelle Reservoir. Meehan has found hiking helps her connect with nature and contributes to mental wellness. (Photo: Kayla Meehan)\nWhat started out as a business relationship has turned into a friendship with the company owner and employees.\n\"I just love the mission that the company has ... of wanting to connect with local hikers,\" she said. \"It's a really cool way how he creates this community of hikers, who doesn't even realize that they're hikers, but he is encouraging people just to get outside.\"\nFounder Joe Vogel revived a historical tradition of giving out Timp Badges for people who summit Mount Timpanogos and expanded the badges to a peak challenge last year. This year, the company has a GOAT Challenge for hiking Utah peaks and an Escape the Noise Challenge for popular family friendly hikes around the Wasatch Front.\nProvo hiker Tennison Hunter thinks it's \"really cool\" what the company has done with the badges because it \"draws a community together.\"\nThe badges were a \"huge inspiration\" for him to work on himself, as Hunter said he was headed down a \"dark path\" three years ago. He decided he wanted to change and began hiking the Y in Provo. After seeing how difficult it was, he was determined to get in better shape, both mentally and physically.\nHunter then saw a news story about the Timp Badges and said it was like \"fuel\" to him. He has hiked Timp every year since — he summited the peak four times last year alone — along with dozens of other trails.\nProvo hiker Tennison Hunter summits Mount Timpanogos in 2024. Hunter has found peace through reconnecting with nature. (Photo: Tennison Hunter)\n\"I think it's really cool because we all like working toward something,\" he said.\nThat drive is now spreading to his kids as they've started tagging along wanting to do hard hikes too. And having a badge you can collect as a reward for completing a challenge certainly doesn't hurt, he added.\n\"There's something about just being in nature. Get out there and test your own limits. You're going to push your own boundaries, and you're going to be surprised with what you are actually capable of,\" he said.\nAn accessible hobby for anyone\nMeehan did four of the badge hikes last year — including hiking Mount Timp for the first time — and has a goal this year to do all of the challenge hikes.\n\"The extra incentive is so much fun, especially if you're the type of person who likes a gold star at the end of a hard hike,\" she said. \"It's cool to look back and see the hard hikes you did and encourage yourself to do ever harder hikes.\"\nEntry-level challenges make hiking more accessible, Meehan said. Not everyone thinks summiting a peak is fun, but almost everyone can enjoy a small hike that helps them connect with nature.\n\"Whether it's five minutes or a five-hour hike, it really does something to clear your mind where it's just really refreshing,\" she said. \"That sense of reconnect is amazing, and having it so close is so special.\"\nShe encourages everyone to explore the state because too many people take the mountains and natural beauty for granted. Meehan finds peace by taking in the moment while on hikes, listening to a river or enjoying the spring blossoms.\nProvo hiker Tennison Hunter summits Mount Timpanogos in 2023. Hunter has found peace through reconnecting with nature. (Photo: Tennison Hunter)\n\"This is such a cool state we live in that offers a diverse landscape, whether I'm in southern Utah wanting to go for a walk in a National Park or I can explore the northern Uintas ... both are doable no matter the skill range. There's so many options and diversity Utah offers to explore and clear your mind (and) appreciate what is around us,\" she said.\nWith technology nowadays, \"everybody wants your attention,\" Hunter said. \"But when you get out into the mountains, it forces you to put away your phone. Anything that comes through, can't until you get back into range. It forces all the distractions to go away.\"\nHunter loves that hiking gives him time to himself to think about who he is and what he wants to do with his life.\n\"It's so peaceful. You get to be with yourself ... it's so simple and that's what you get and it's so enjoyable all at the same time. It's so easy to get caught up in the next thing, but it forces you to be present. Nothing beats it. I love it,\" he said.\nThe Key Takeaways for this article were generated with the assistance of large language models and reviewed by our editorial team.

    "title": "3 surprising ways to reverse insulin resistance and obesity — 3 is the craziest!",
    "content": "(NDABCREATIVITY/Adobe Stock)\nEstimated read time: 6-7 minutes\nThis story is sponsored by Health Utah.\nYou're fat and tired.\nIt's not insulin's fault. Insulin is just the messenger. When sugar levels are high in the bloodstream, insulin instructs body cells to open their doors and allow sugar in. But under certain circumstances cells ignore insulin's message and the doors remain shut.\nWhen the doors stay shut, you've got two problems. One, you don't get enough fuel (sugar) into the cells, so you're tired. Two, sugar stays in the bloodstream where it causes damage. In an effort to prevent this damage, the sugar is removed and stored as fat.\nSo, you're fat and tired.\nHow likely is it that you have insulin resistance? \"Pretty likely ,and getting more likely all the time,\" says Dr. Whit Roberts, D.C. of Health Utah.\nThe percentage of adults with insulin resistance has doubled in the last 20 years, according to research published in the National Library of Medicine. Cleveland Clinic reports this is due to many factors including worsening diets, the exposure to more drugs and toxins, more stress and more fat.\n\"Insulin resistance is perhaps the most serious epidemic in the world today, Roberts says. \"It can lead to all the major killers including heart disease, obesity, strokes, diabetes and 13 types of cancer. The good news is that we are learning all the time better ways to reverse it. Some are surprising.\"\nPhoto: Pixel-Shot - stock.adobe.com\nA 2022 study published in the National Library of Medicine showed that people who get less than seven hours of sleep have higher levels of insulin resistance.\n\"This is a problem since well over half my patients have some form of insomnia. They struggle falling asleep, staying asleep, or just getting sound sleep,\" Roberts says. \"That's why at Health Utah, improving our patients' quality and quantity of sleep is one of our highest priorities.\"\nGetting enough sleep, however, is easier said than done.\n\"Fortunately, we have found that lowering total body inflammation through a proprietary combination of herbs, foods and therapies leads to improved sleep in almost all of our patients,\" Roberts says.\nPhoto: Nasnunt - stock.adobe.com\nThe second surprising way to reverse insulin resistance is to increase your consumption of antioxidants. One study showed that taking 2 grams of vitamin C for two weeks resulted in a significant change in insulin resistance. Roberts explains this is why Health Utah's health and weight loss program relies heavily on eating foods rich in antioxidants. Additionally certain foods with high polyphenol and phytonutrient content are recommended as they have also been found to help.\nOf course, this is the hard part. Everyone knows they should be eating better. It's just hard when low-quality foods are flavor-enhanced, sugar-laced, caffeine boosted and so convenient. That's why the health and weight loss program at Health Utah focuses heavily on making the transition to healing foods easier. They use a process called framework that engages the subconscious mind to reframe your relationship with food. Weekly classes and educational materials also provide skills, tools, and strategies necessary to achieve sustainable weight loss.\nPhoto: hocine - stock.adobe.com\nThe craziest way science has found to help reverse insulin resistance is drinking lemon juice. Scientific research is now reflecting what holistic healers have suggested for years, that lemon juice has a powerful effect for good in the body, even improving sensitivity to insulin and lowering blood sugar levels.\nRoberts and Health Utah utilize this kind of knowledge in working with their patients. Lemon juice has been a consistent part of their health and weight loss program for over 10 years.\n\"When our patients start their health and weight loss program, they begin by cleaning out the body. This requires improving liver function,\" Roberts says. \"Lemons, herbs and in-office therapies facilitate this detoxification as well as the reversal of insulin resistance.\"\nHealth Utah specializes in sustainable weight loss. Everything they do is geared toward this goal. Their coaching, their classes, their work with the subconscious mind, the fact that they don't count calories or cut out carbs and their focus on reversing insulin resistance create a lasting solution to the health and weight issues of their patients.\nHealth Utah invites KSL readers to take advantage of a $59 weight loss package. The package allows two people to get body scans. These scans identify potential underlying conditions that cause insulin resistance and stubborn weight. You will walk away with a 17-page report detailing the findings.\nRoberts will review the results of the scan with you, correlate its findings with your health history. This provides a tremendous amount of information allowing him to make valuable recommendations.\nYou will also be able to fill out a proprietary survey that will give you insight into health issues that likely compromise your weight loss efforts. Thousands of KSL readers have taken this survey and been amazed at the information it provides.\nThere is no obligation. Find out now why you are struggling with your health and weight issues.

    "content": "Utah Gov. Spencer Cox went on a previously delayed trade mission to Canada this month, expressing optimism despite escalating trade tensions between neighbors. (Michelle Budge, Deseret News)\nEstimated read time: 5-6 minutes\nTORONTO — Utah Gov. Spencer Cox told top Canadian officials and investors that now was the best time for Utah to lead a trade mission to the country and said he would encourage his fellow governors to do the same.\nAs the first governor to visit Canada since President Donald Trump implemented a new global tariff regime, Cox expressed optimism about the strength of the U.S.-Canada relationship in meetings with Ontario Premier Doug Ford and the Toronto business community on Thursday.\n\"Subnational relationships are more important than they've ever been before,\" Cox said, speaking at a \"Why Utah\" luncheon. \"This will work itself out at some point, and when it does, I'm here to tell you that Utah and Ontario will have even stronger relationships because of it.\"\nDuring his four years in office, Cox has continued the practice of leading one or two trade missions a year. The Canada trip was originally planned for last year but was rescheduled for 2025 before the international economic upheaval following Trump's \"liberation day\" tariffs announcement last week.\nOther than China, few nations have been as impacted by the new trade levies as Canada. Canada is the second largest overall trading partner with the U.S. and with Utah. Despite having very few barriers to American trade, Canada was the target of Trump's first tariff announcement and has been disproportionately impacted by industry-specific tariffs.\nThe tariffs on Canadian products include a 25% charge for automobiles, auto parts and up to $360 billion of other goods that fall outside of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA; 10% on non-USMCA compliant energy and minerals; and 25% on all steel and aluminum imports to the U.S.\nIn response to the tariffs, Canada has imposed reciprocal 25% tariffs on around $60 billion of American goods and non-USMCA compliant vehicles. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney stated last month that the U.S.-Canada relationship as the world had known it was \"over.\"\nOn Thursday, Cox said he understood Canadians' sense of \"betrayal\" but said he was hopeful about the future of U.S.-Canada relations because of what he had seen during his week in Canada.\nBefore the trip, Cox said he was asked whether he still planned to visit Canada amid the market turmoil and political tensions.\n\"There was no hesitation,\" Cox said. \"It was the exact opposite. I'm more excited because of what's happening now, because I think the opportunities are even greater.\"\nFollowing an hourlong meeting with his executive counterpart in Ontario, Cox told reporters at the province's legislative building that he will have conversations with Trump about the future of his tariff policy.\nCox, the previous chairman of the National Governors Association, also said he plans to send a letter to his fellow governors, urging them to follow Utah's lead by visiting Canada.\n\"He's the very first governor in 2025 to come to Canada, writ large, and spending the time here is incredibly important during these very, very challenging times,\" said Brad Harper, of the U.S. consulate in Canada.\nCox's delegation, made up of around 30 cabinet members, state lawmakers, business leaders and university administrators, has spent the last week meeting with government agencies and industry experts in Quebec and Ontario to signal Utah's desire to forge additional economic ties in the areas of critical minerals and artificial intelligence.\nIn private diplomatic settings and during Thursday's \"Why Utah\" presentation with World Trade Center Utah and the Governor's Office of Economic Opportunity, Cox pitched Utah as the best-positioned state in the union to attract Canadian business and to strengthen cross-border ties.\n\"Utah (is) the gem of the United States economic machine,\" Cox said.\nIn 2024, the state had the highest gross domestic product growth in the United States at 4.5% — double the national GDP growth — according to the University of Utah's Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute.\nUtah has also been ranked the No. 1 state by U.S. News & World Report for two years running, the best place to start a business, the state with the highest social mobility, the state with the largest growth in the last census and the state with the best economic outlook for 17 years in a row.\n\"We are open for business,\" Cox said. \"We recognize that the economic ties between your country and our country run deep, but it is so much more than just economics — you are our closest friend, our closest ally.\"\nJonathan Freedman, the CEO of World Trade Center Utah, which helped to organize the trade mission, said there are 112 Canadian-owned businesses in the state of Utah employing around 5,000 people.\nIn addition to hosting the Winter Olympics again in 2034, Freedman touted Utah as the most multilingual state in the country, with 131 languages being spoken by current residents of the state.\n\"We're internationally minded,\" Freedman said, showing a picture of Cox and Ford holding up hockey jerseys from each others' NHL teams.\nIn 2024, Utah's trade volume totaled $40.1 billion, including $18.2 billion in exports to other countries, a 5% increase from the year prior. Of those exports, $1.5 billion were to Canada. That same year, Utah imported $4.7 billion in goods from Canada.\nRyan Starks, the executive director of the Governor's Office of Economic Opportunity, pointed out that while Utah is a mid-sized state, the Wasatch Front more closely resembles the greater Orlando and Charlotte metropolitan areas in terms of population.\nStarks also highlighted the state's economic development tax credits, as well as the state's high median income and interconnectedness as the crossroads of many international flights, the railway system and inland ports.\nRead the full article at Deseret.com.\nMost recent Politics stories\nUS deports another 10 gang members to El Salvador, Rubio says\n'They want it all': Bernie Sanders condemns billionaires during Salt Lake rally\nPennsylvania governor residence set on fire by arsonist, police say\nBrigham Tomco covers Utah’s congressional delegation for the national politics team at the Deseret News.

    "content": "A Pennsylvania man remained jailed on Sunday after being accused by authorities of planning a mass school shooting for later this month. (Chuck Franklin, Alamy )\nEstimated read time: 2-3 minutes\nSTATE COLLEGE, Pa. — A Pennsylvania man remained jailed on Sunday after being accused by authorities of planning a mass school shooting for later this month that would have coincided with the anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre.\nPolice allege Braeden Phillips, 20, had planned to commit a mass shooting at State College High School in Central Pennsylvania on April 21, one day after the 26th anniversary of the deadly Columbine High School shooting, according to a criminal complaint.\nPolice allege Phillips had compiled a \"hit list\" and that the shooting would have taken place at around 8:40 a.m. — a high traffic time for students and staff — near the school's main staircase. Officials cited in the complaint allege that Phillips planned to place bombs in the school bathrooms.\nTwo teenage boys went on a killing rampage at Columbine High School in suburban Denver on April 20, 1999. They shot and killed 12 classmates and a teacher, and wounded two dozen others before taking their own lives.\nPhillips has been charged with conspiracy to commit murder and unlawful possession of a firearm. He was being held without bond at the Centre County Correctional Facility because he was deemed an \"extreme danger to the community,\" according to court records.\nCourt records did not list an attorney who could speak on his behalf.\nPolice were trying to determine if anyone else was involved in the plan. Authorities allege Phillips said a juvenile friend of his also was going to take part in the shooting.\n\"State College Police would like to recognize that the success of this investigation would not have been possible without the initial report made by a concerned citizen. This illustrates the importance of 'see something, say something,'\" police said in a statement.\nAuthorities were first alerted to the plot by staff members at a Centre County youth center, who told police a resident had shared information about it. Police interviewed Phillips' friends and others, who told investigators that Phillips detailed how he planned to carry out the shooting and showed them a handgun.\nWhen police asked if Phillips had any issues or past grievances with State College High School, a friend said Phillips had told him, \"the school did not serve his educational needs and failed him,\" according to the complaint.\nPolice allege Phillips initially planned to carry out the shooting on April 20, which would have been the 26th anniversary of the Columbine shooting, but that he changed the date because April 20 falls on a Sunday this year.\nPhillips was set to have a preliminary court hearing on Wednesday.\nMost recent Police & Courts stories\n17-year-old in Wisconsin allegedly killed parents as part of plot to assassinate Trump, FBI says\nOgden recycling center owner charged with releasing pollutants into Weber River\nLori Vallow Daybell's 2nd trial: A veteran prosecutor's perspective\nMore stories you may be interested in\nState Department says deported Maryland resident 'alive and secure' in El Salvador\nBLM warns against illegal parties on public lands after breaking up nonpermitted rave\nHB267 opponents plan final weekend push to qualify referendum for ballot",

    "content": "Adam Day, Day Violins owner, inspects a customer’s violin brought in for repairs at Day Violins in Murray on March 20. (Kristin Murphy, Deseret News)\nEstimated read time: 4-5 minutes\nAdam Day Violins in Murray specializes in handcrafted, old-world string instruments.\nHe has produced nearly 7,000 violins.\nEndorsed by musicians like Joshua Bell, Day's violins range in value up to $24,000.\nSALT LAKE CITY — The lights are on in the shop where Adam Day and his band of violin-makers ply their craft. But if the lights weren't on? No worries. They'd still have a job.\nThe whole technological infrastructure could collapse, the industrial revolution could have never happened, and there would still be a place for luthiers, i.e. craftsmen who build or repair stringed instruments the old-world way: by hand.\n\"The joke around here is that we work in the kind of place where Napoleon is new news,\" says Day, the founder and owner of Adam Day Violins, indulging in a bit of luthier humor.\nThe name actually comes from the lute, a 15th century French instrument that looks like a bloated banjo. People who made lutes were called luthiers. When the violin, viola, bass and cello came along, luthier became a catch-all for the artisans who shaped them.\n\"It's not everyone's career choice,\" deadpans Day. \"When you tell someone what you do, it's always, 'Really?' What? That's a thing?'\"\nBut it's his career choice, and to him, it's a dream job. Quite literally.\nDay was 14 years old when his violin teacher, Kelly Richardson, told him he'd had a dream about Day making violins.\n\"I came to my violin lesson one day,\" Day recalls, \"and he said he'd had this dream and it was so vivid he thought maybe I ought to look into it.\"\nAdam Day, Day Violins owner, carves a custom cello bridge at Day Violins in Murray on March 20. (Photo: Kristin Murphy, Deseret News)\nThat was 32 years ago. With the exception of a two-year break for a Latter-day Saint mission to Chile, Adam has been honing his craft as a luthier ever since. First came the better part of a decade learning and relearning the basics from world-renowned Utah luthier Paul Hart.\nThat was followed by the founding of his shop a little over 25 years ago in December 2000.\nSometime this summer, Adam Day Violins (adamdayviolins.com) will produce its 7,000th instrument.\nEnzo Vecchiarelli, 3, checks out a violin with his mother Nicolle Atkinson, who is a violin teacher, as they visit Day Violins in Murray on March 20. (Photo: Kristin Murphy, Deseret News)\nHeadquarters for all this artisanship is on State Street in the heart of Murray. Adam's violin-making shop is tucked in behind Day Murray Music, a business that doesn't quite date back to Napoleon but, nonetheless, is one of the oldest businesses in Murray.\nAdam Day's grandparents, Arlette and John Day, opened the music store just after the end of World War II, in 1949, selling sheet music, record players, vinyl records and refrigerators. Today, Adam Day's parents, Clint and Rosanne Day, along with his brother Jared Day, manage the store.\nThey still sell all things music, including a prodigious amount of sheet music, but no refrigerators.\nAdam Day, Day Violins owner, works on a cello at Day Violins in Murray on March 20. (Photo: Kristin Murphy, Deseret News)\nThe pace slows noticeably when you walk the few steps from the retail store to Day's violin shop. Suddenly, you're in a sanctuary of wooden instruments, with a window to watch the luthiers as they make or build up the violins, violas, cellos and basses that will replace the ones being sold.\nPrices range from just a few hundred dollars to $24,000. That's the price for a custom-made Adam Day violin.\nAdam Day, Day Violins owner, inspects a customer’s violin brought in for repairs at Day Violins in Murray on March 20. (Photo: Kristin Murphy, Deseret News)\nDay says it takes 200 hours for him to make a violin from scratch, and that's if the tone sounds right when he plays it. If not, it's back to the drawing board trying to figure out why.\n\"Even though the time spent making it dictates that it should be a $20,000 violin, if the tone quality isn't up to speed, it's not going to sell for that,\" says Day. \"So I have to find out why. Maybe I have to take off the top and thin it down to be more resonant, just to give an example.\"\nHaving a keen musical ear is one of three main attributes Day says a luthier needs to be successful. The other two are an artistic eye — because a violin is also a work of art — and good hand-eye coordination.\nAbby Kagie, Day Violins sales floor manager, restrings a violin for a customer at Day Violins in Murray on March 20. (Photo: Kristin Murphy, Deseret News)\n\"You have to have the hands of a surgeon, really, because all of the measurements and all the fits are so precise,\" says Day.\nIt also doesn't hurt to have other musicians love what you make.\nDay's career got a jump start in the beginning when Joshua Bell, one of America's foremost violinists, a Grammy-award winner no less, played two of Day's first three custom violins and gave them his unqualified endorsement.\n\"He was one of the first individuals who made me feel like I had a future in violin making,\" says Day. Many others have followed suit. His website (adamdayviolins.com) is crowded with endorsements from professional musicians.\nAdam Day, Day Violins owner, diagnoses sound quality issues on a violin Chris Robison brought in for his daughter at Day Violins in Murray on March 20. (Photo: Kristin Murphy, Deseret News)\nHe doesn't regret not going the traditional college route when it seemed everyone was telling him that was what he needed to do.\n\"'You'll never make a living this way, you need to go to college and get your degree' — I got told that a lot,\" says Day. \"I think it's sad when people say you have to jump through certain hoops to be successful because that's not what I experienced.\"\nHe is quick to add, \"It's a miracle, this whole business I get to do is a miracle to me.\"\nAnd he doesn't need computers to do it.

    "content": "(OARS Whitewater Rafting )\nEstimated read time: 4-5 minutes\nThis story is sponsored by OARS Whitewater Rafting.\nThere's no denying that Utah's Mighty 5—Zion, Bryce Canyon, Arches, Canyonlands, and Capitol Reef—are some of the most breathtaking national parks in the country.\nBut just beyond their well-worn paths lies another incredible destination that often gets overlooked: Dinosaur National Monument.\nStraddling the Utah-Colorado border, Dinosaur National Monument is located just a 3.5-hour drive from Salt Lake City, and every bit as awe-inspiring as its more famous national park counterparts.\nDespite the monument's proximity to the state's most populated city and major travel hub, Dinosaur National Monument remains far less crowded than Utah's other national park sites.\nInstead of competing for parking spots and jostling for viewpoints, those willing to venture just a little off the beaten path are rewarded with 149-million-year-old dinosaur fossils, great hiking, and world-class whitewater rafting.\nThe best-kept secret: Rafting in Dinosaur National Monument\nWhile the majority of the park's approximately 300,000 visitors per year stick with the main attractions, most miss out on the most immersive way to experience Dinosaur National Monument.\nThe Green and Yampa Rivers carve through the heart of the park, offering some of the most stunning and remote whitewater rafting opportunities in the country and the best way to explore this national park site.\nOARS, an authorized concessioner of Dinosaur National Monument and a trusted Utah rafting outfitter, offers a number of rafting trips ranging from 1 to 5 days.\nMulti-day adventures: Gates of Lodore rafting & Yampa River trips\nOn a Green River rafting trip through the Gates of Lodore paddlers head deep into Dinosaur's remote wilderness with breathtaking red rock walls, secluded sandy beaches, and exciting Class III rapids like Harp Falls, Triplet Falls, and Hells Half Mile.\nAlong the way on this 44-mile adventure, rafters stop at hidden waterfalls, explore ancient petroglyphs, and camp under star-filled skies. OARS also operates trips in spring and early summer on the free-flowing Yampa, considered by many to be one of the best river trips in the U.S.\nOne-day thrill: Split Mountain Canyon\nFor those short on time, a one-day Split Mountain Canyon rafting trip is the best way to experience the park's spectacular geology and scenery and spend a fun day on the water.\nThis action-packed trip covers nine miles of the Green River, with exciting Class III rapids interspersed with calm stretches where rafters can soak in the towering canyon walls.\nThis full day trip is an excellent option for families and beginners looking for a taste of whitewater adventure, plus teachers, active duty military, veterans and first responders raft free with OARS in Split Mountain with one or more full-paying guests.\nThe main attractions: Things to do in Dinosaur National Monument\nStep into prehistory at the Quarry Exhibit Hall\nDinosaur National Monument is home to one of the richest fossil beds and significant paleontological sites in the world. Its main attraction, the Quarry Exhibit Hall, showcases a massive rock wall embedded with over 1,500 dinosaur fossils, including bones from long-extinct species such as Allosaurus, Apatosaurus, and Stegosaurus.\nHike through time and canyons\nThe Sound of Silence Trail is a lesser-visited loop that winds through the colorful badlands and upturned rock layers that showcase the monument's geologic diversity.\nA ¼-mile connector trail allows you to combine this with the Desert Voices Trail for stunning views of Split Mountain. For a shorter option with a decent amount of shade, the Hog Canyon Trail located near the Josie Bassett Cabin—a historic homestead from the early 20th century—provides a glimpse into the rugged lifestyle of Utah's early settlers while showcasing the monument's striking rock formations and wildlife.\nDiscover ancient stories in rock art\nPetroglyphs and pictographs left behind by the Fremont people over 1,000 years ago add another fascinating layer to the monument's rich history.\nVisitors can easily access several sites on the Utah side of the monument, including those along Cub Creek Road, where large, well-preserved figures of humans, animals, and abstract shapes were etched and painted into the sandstone cliffs. Another excellent stop on this 10-mile scenic drive is the Swelter Shelter Petroglyphs.\nWhere to stay near Dinosaur National Monument\nVernal, Utah, is the ideal base for those visiting Dinosaur National Monument. Just a short drive from the park's main entrance in Jensen, the town offers a variety of lodging options, dining, grocery stores, and is the meeting place for OARS Dinosaur rafting trips.\nAccommodations range from well-known chain hotels to locally owned motels like the Dinosaur Inn, while nearby campgrounds and the Fossil Valley RV Park also provide easy access to the monument and surrounding outdoor attractions.\nOARS Whitewater Rafting\nViral 'chicken jockey' trend gets Provo student removed from theater, and other from April 13, 2025.\nMore stories you may be interested in\nHiker in critical condition after fall in Little Cottonwood Canyon\nMaking old-world violins in the heart of Murray\n'Visionary' Ronald Wopsock, longtime Ute leader, dies at 72",

    "content": "Author Sarah Eden poses before signing books at a Deseret Book event at the City Creek Center in Salt Lake City on April 4. She says she started writing books on a dare. (Tess Crowley, Deseret News)\nEstimated read time: 5-6 minutes\nSarah M. Eden, a clean romance author, began writing after a dare by her mother.\nHer debut, \"The Ramshackle Knight,\" was self-published and later picked up by Covenant.\nEden has published 80 books, selling 1.5 million copies, including bestseller \"Seeking Persephone.\"\nSALT LAKE CITY — Fifteen minutes until the book signing is to begin and already the line in the maze is getting crowded, stretching toward the back of the store. These are Sarah M. Eden fans, romantics at heart, awaiting the arrival of the woman who has filled their lives with clean romance novels.\nEden feels their need; she understands where they are coming from. She, too, wants to read love stories that leave much to the imagination — a lot more Jane Austen than Jackie Collins. It's why she became a writer in the first place.\nWell, that and the dare from her mom.\nLet's go back to 2004 and set that scene:\nEden, 25 years old at the time, and her mother, Ginny, are in the kitchen of Ginny's house in Glendale, Arizona. Eden is complaining, telling her mom how frustrated she is at finding a decent romance story at the library. Book after book, she'll get partway through and have to quit reading because the content becomes trashy. Plus, the plots are too often flimsy, and the writing is weak.\nTo which her mother replies: \"Why don't you write your own book?\"\nIt was a sympathetic reply, an innocuous throwaway line to end the rant, to which Eden — whose relationship to books to this point in her life has been to read them, not write them — says nothing in response.\nBut she went home and wrote her own book.\nAuthor Sarah Eden signs South Jordan resident Ruby Cheesman’s book at a Deseret Book event at the City Creek Center in Salt Lake City on April 4. (Photo: Tess Crowley, Deseret News)\nIt took her 18 months to do it. Eden, who graduated from BYU with a degree in statistical data analysis, leaves nothing to chance; she's a planner. If she was going to write a book, she was going to learn how first.\nBetween and around taking care of her young family — her husband Paul Eden, who was in grad school getting his MBA, and their two children, 1-year-old Catherine and 4-year-old Jonathan — she got busy. She checked out every book at the library about writing she could get her hands on (Stephen King and Donald Maass were two favorites), she signed up for writers' workshops, she dove deep into the internet to learn about plotting and editing and organization.\n\"I could do it just about anywhere,\" Eden says, \"as long as I had a computer or a piece of paper and pen — and the kids' naps were overlapping.\"\nAuthor Sarah Eden motions for the first group in line to come to her table to have their books signed at a Deseret Book event at the City Creek Center in Salt Lake City on April 4. (Photo: Tess Crowley, Deseret News)\nA year and a half later, on Mother's Day of 2006, Sarah Eden drove to her mother's house and gave her mom her present: an 80,000-word manuscript with the title \"The Ramshackle Knight.\"\nGinny was dumbfounded. She had no warning what her daughter had been up to. And also, she'll admit 19 years later, she was anxious.\n\"I have to say I was a little nervous about reading it,\" she said. \"What if it's not good? What am I going to say to her without crushing her?\"\nThat night she curled up with her daughter's first manuscript. She couldn't put it down. She read it in one sitting.\nThe next day she called Eden and said this: \"It's like a real book.\"\n\"Still my favorite review I've ever received,\" says Eden.\nAuthor Sarah Eden signs books at a Deseret Book event at the City Creek Center in Salt Lake City on April 4. (Photo: Tess Crowley, Deseret News)\nNow properly motivated, Eden used Amazon's print-on-demand service to self-publish \"The Ramshackle Knight.\" Just five or six copies were printed, but she now had a bound book in her hands she could shop to real publishers.\nIt wasn't long before Covenant Communications, a Salt Lake publishing company that caters to a mostly Latter-day Saint audience, bought the rights to \"The Ramshackle Knight,\" changed the title to \"The Kiss of a Stranger\" and effectively launched the career of Sarah M. Eden.\nShe was already at work on several more books, all of them historical fiction, the majority taking place in 18th and 19th century Europe. Through a variety of publishers, and some that have been self-published, she has been releasing her romance novels as if on a conveyor belt ever since. This May she'll publish her 80th book. That's an average of four a year since she first started plotting \"Ramshackle Knight.\" (The notably prolific novelist John Grisham, for one frame of reference, has published 54 books in twice the amount of time).\nIn 2021 and 2022, Eden released eight books each year. In 2023, she passed the 1 million mark in books sold; today that number is approaching 1.5 million. That includes \"Seeking Persephone,\" her all-time bestseller that was made into a movie this year in England and is scheduled to be streaming by the end of the year.\nAuthor Sarah Eden poses before signing books at a Deseret Book event at the City Creek Center in Salt Lake City on April 4. (Photo: Tess Crowley, Deseret News)\nAll the while, her fan base keeps growing, as was evident when she ended a three-city book tour at the downtown Salt Lake City Deseret Book store on conference weekend in early April.\nBefore wading through the crowd to the podium to start signing her latest book, \"The Tides of Time,\" Eden reflected on the serendipitous way the writing whirlwind that has become her life began.\n\"I mean, if my mom hadn't issued that challenge, I don't think I'd have ever even discovered it,\" she said, \"because it never occurred to me to even try. I had grown up believing that authors were these spectacular, like already incredible, amazing people, that you had to be something special to be an author. And I didn't feel like that was who I was, but her challenge was enough for me to give it a try, and I discovered that if you have stories in you, you're an author, that's all it really takes.\"\nShe smiled before adding, \"I don't know of another writer who started on a dare.\"\nAuthor Sarah Eden signs books at a Deseret Book event at the City Creek Center in Salt Lake City on April 4.

(Photo: Tess Crowley, Deseret News)\nBallerina Farm, a Utah business founded and owned by Hannah and Daniel Neeleman, has achieved worldwide fame from the content its creators share with their 10 million Instagram followers. Hannah Neeleman's from-scratch cooking, her background as a Juilliard-trained ballerina, her love for raising her eight children and the family's idyllic rural lifestyle have attracted considerable attention.\nThe Neelemans' stated purpose for founding Ballerina Farm is a love of agriculture and the land.\n\"We've always wanted to create a space where our community can get closer to the land and enjoy fresh, high-quality foods from our farm and beyond,\" Hannah and Daniel Neeleman said in a press release.\nWhile the farm has been selling products from its online store for years, this stand is its first brick-and-mortar location.\nEmployee Charlee Bell, left, talks to a fellow employee as employee Lilly Fryer, right, works on paperwork inside Ballerina Farm’s new farm stand in Kamas on Thursday, April 11. (Photo: Tess Crowley, Deseret News)\nThe Ballerina Farm Stand is located in Kamas, just south of Ballerina Farm proper. Despite its small size, the stand stocks all of the farm's food products, including its signature protein powder, organic flour, sourdough starter kits, frozen baked goods and frozen meat.\nBallerina Farm has also announced a flagship market, Ballerina Farm Store, which will be coming soon to Midway, in nearby Wasatch County. The store will stock all the farm's products alongside local and small-batch items curated from around the world.\nThe Ballerina Farm Stand is notable for being the only location where the farm sells its raw milk.\n\"Sharing the raw milk from our dairy is something we've been dreaming of since starting Ballerina Farm in 2017,\" the Neelemans said.\nEmployee Lilly Fryer carries herbs for a customer at Ballerina Farm’s new farm stand in Kamas on Thursday, April 11. (Photo: Tess Crowley, Deseret News)\nThe raw milk is bottled with a tag that states, \"Raw milk no matter how carefully produced can be unsafe.\" According to the CDC, raw milk can be a source of germs and foodborne illness.\n\"While good practices on farms can reduce contamination, they cannot guarantee safety from harmful germs,\" the CDC's website states.\nAccording to an infographic shared on the Ballerina Farm Store's Instagram page, the raw milk is A2 certified, which means those with dairy sensitivities may find it easier to digest.\n\"A2 milk comes from cows that genetically produce the A2 protein, instead of the A1 protein,\" the post reads. \"At Ballerina Farm, our herd is comprised of only A2 certified cows, allowing more people to enjoy dairy again.\"\nThe Ballerina Farm stand is open Tuesday-Friday 9 a.m.-6 p.m. and Saturday 9 a.m.-3 p.m.\nThe Key Takeaways for this article were generated with the assistance of large language models and reviewed by our editorial team.

    "title": "Lori Vallow Daybell's 2nd trial: A veteran prosecutor's perspective",
    "content": "'She is her own worst enemy': Prosecutor reacts to Lori Daybell trial\nEstimated read time: 3-4 minutes\nVeteran prosecutor Rachel Smith critiques Lori Vallow Daybell's self-representation in trial.\nSmith notes Vallow Daybell's courtroom tactics and missed opportunities during proceedings.\nSmith suggests Vallow Daybell's demeanor may negatively impact jury perception and case outcome.\nSALT LAKE CITY — In the ongoing second trial of Lori Vallow Daybell in Arizona, Rachel Smith, a veteran prosecutor who played a key role in securing the first conviction against Daybell in Idaho, has weighed in on the proceedings.\nRepresenting herself, Daybell's courtroom demeanor and tactics have sparked significant reactions. Daybell is accused of conspiring with her brother, Alex Cox, to kill her husband, Charles Vallow, in July 2019.\nSmith is now observing the trial from the sidelines.\n\"She is probably going to go down in history as an example of why you're not your own lawyer,\" she said.\nDespite some moments of competence, Smith noted that Daybell has missed critical opportunities to object and has made the trial largely about herself and perceived wrongdoings against her.\nSmith said the trial has revealed Daybell's calculated nature, particularly during her cross-examinations. Her interactions with witnesses, including Serena Sharpe and Nancy Jo Hancock, have been pivotal.\nSharpe, who was friends with Daybell in late 2018 through early 2019, testified about Daybell's involvement in a \"casting out\" ritual aimed at expelling an evil spirit from Charles Vallow months before his death. As Sharpe grew skeptical of Daybell's extreme religious beliefs, the former friend said Daybell started excluding her.\nIn court, Daybell's cross-examination of Sharpe was aggressive and tense.\n\"When Serena didn't buy into that, she became public enemy, whatever Lori's list was,\" Smith said.\nSmith also highlighted the irony in Daybell's fiery cross-examination of Nancy Jo Hancock, a woman who went on a date with Charles Vallow the night before his death.\n\"Even though Lori didn't mean to, her cross-examination of Nancy Jo helped the prosecution,\" Smith said.\nDuring the cross-examination, Daybell accused Hancock of dating a married man while the prosecution alleges she was motivated by a $1-million life insurance policy and the desire to marry her paramour, Chad Daybell, that led to her conspiring in Vallow's killing.\n\"I literally was sitting there saying 'hypocrite, hypocrite,' to my computer screen because Charles wasn't planning her death. Charles wasn't trying to figure out how to get her death to finance his new life with his new girlfriend,\" Smith said.\nShe said Daybell's lack of emotion toward her late husband will not be lost on the jury.\n\"You have someone who went on one date with a man who choked up, and Lori hasn't choked up ever about Charles' death. The jury will see that,\" Smith said.\nSmith believes Daybell's demeanor may hurt her case if the jury sees her as capable of orchestrating a conspiracy.\n\"The jury is going to see her not as this meek, mild, demure, 'I couldn't hurt anybody' person. They are going to see her as somebody who is large and in charge,\" Smith said. \"It's also going to hurt her if she later, in Idaho, attempts to turn around and say, 'Hey, I really was crazy or I really was incompetent.'\"\nThe trial has also revealed the prosecution's restraint in handling the case, Smith said. She praised deputy Maricopa County attorney Treena Kay for adhering to ethical standards and maintaining fairness despite the challenges of Daybell representing herself.\n\"When a prosecutor is going against somebody who is representing themselves on a very serious case, it is the opposite of what a lot of people think. You don't take advantage of it. An ethical prosecutor really doubles down and becomes absolutely very careful,\" Smith said.\nAs the trial progresses, concerns have arisen about the dwindling number of alternate jurors, with only two remaining. Smith suggested that if more jurors are excused, sequestering the remaining jurors might become necessary.\nLooking ahead, Smith expressed skepticism about Daybell taking the stand.\n\"I would really be shocked if Lori (Daybell) testifies because she doesn't want to have anyone else in charge,\" Smith said.\nThe Key Takeaways for this article were generated with the assistance of large language models and reviewed by our editorial team.
