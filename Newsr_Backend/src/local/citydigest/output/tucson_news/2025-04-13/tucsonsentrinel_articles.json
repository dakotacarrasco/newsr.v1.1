    "content": "Lack of standards, transparency undermines police LGBTQ+ programs\nAcross Arizona, police tout liaison programs as trust-building tools, but a report reveals inconsistent roles across departments\nPosted Apr 12, 2025, 11:19 am\nIn 2011, Ron Blake said he was raped in his Phoenix condo by his former partner and two others. Though Blake reported the rape the night it happened, and though police showed up and escorted at least one of the men home, it took four years for police to investigate the matter in earnest.\nDiagnosed with dissociative amnesia and still struggling to clearly recall the incident, Blake was finally introduced to Julie Smith, a Phoenix police detective who served as the department’s LGBTQ+ liaison on his case. Smith spoke to Blake about the events of that night and escorted him to request an order of protection, which was ultimately denied. Despite that, it was never clear to Blake how Smith was supposed to help him.\nA few months later, Blake stopped hearing from Smith entirely. Written testimony from a former detective showed she kept no notes of their interactions. He felt abandoned, and he questioned the purpose of the person who was supposed to be a bridge between the police department and the LGBTQ+ community.\n“You can’t tell people everything’s OK for LGBTQ+ people and how they’re being treated by police if I’m still experiencing this,” Blake said. “Their purpose should be to walk me through this. I’m coming out of a deep sleep — I need consistency.”\nThe job of LGBTQ+ liaison is not an uncommon one in Arizona police departments. Many local agencies — including the largest cop shops in the Valley — have programs meant to provide support for specific communities, foster trust in reporting crimes and encourage people to work with police.\nYet, there is little evidence from local police departments that they have done any of that. A LOOKOUT and Phoenix New Times investigation reveals that many of the people in these positions simply do not serve a clear purpose. None of these departments have accreditation for an LGBTQ+ liaison program, and police have been quiet on what trainings exist across different departments that have a liaison in place. In at least one case, in Flagstaff, a liaison was completely absent during a critical moment for the community.\nSuch an undertaking by police departments seemingly couldn't come at a better time for groups under siege. But a deeper look at the record shows that too many of these commitments have been all talk — if even that.\nWhat is an LGBTQ+ police liaison?\nIn addition to Phoenix, at least 10 other cities in Arizona currently have a designated liaison program: Chandler, Glendale, Tempe, Mesa, Avondale, Gilbert, Peoria, Scottsdale, Flagstaff and Tucson. At its core, LGBTQ+ police liaisons exist to mend the relationship between the LGBTQ+ community and law enforcement, which has been fraught for decades.\nIn Phoenix, that distrust can be traced back at least to the Eighth Day raid in 1964. In the early morning hours one Sunday, Phoenix police raided Eighth Day Coffee House, an LGBTQ+ social club at 915 N. 1st Street in Downtown Phoenix. They arrested more than 20 people on charges ranging from “lewd and lascivious acts” to “drunk-and-disorderly conduct.” The Arizona Republic printed the names of those arrested, and many lost their jobs.\nThere are other examples. Phoenix police spied on a local gay bar in the 1990s. Cops clashed with undocumented queer protesters at a Phoenix Pride event a decade ago. Recent cases of gay men and trans people being murdered or assaulted have spurred accusations that police are not taking anti-LGBTQ+ bias seriously.\nLiaison programs are intended to repair that broken trust and offer safety and guidance for LGBTQ+ victims, who are 6.5 percent less likely to report crimes than their non-LGBTQ+ counterparts, according to a 2024 report by the ACLU. But simply staffing a liaison isn’t enough.\nIn 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice said as much in a document from its Office of Community-Oriented Policing Services. The document outlined ways police should interact with LGBTQ+ folks, highlighting the need for more direct conversations, a constant reevaluation of internal practices and procedures, establishing citizen/community police academies that include a focus on LGBTQ+ people’s needs, having a presence at LGBTQ+ events and engagement with queer organizations.\nThe publication recognized Phoenix PD’s Advisory Board and its two designated LGBTQ+ liaisons’ efforts to “create a climate of trust between the community and the Phoenix Police Department” and “provide a forum where the Phoenix Police Department can listen actively to community concerns and create solutions to social problems.”\nBut in 2023, the Arizona Mirror and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism called into question the transparency and efficacy of that same board, claiming the department “releases virtually no information about what the 12 boards do, what they discuss or how — if at all — leadership incorporates any feedback from the boards into police tactics.”\nPatrick Kelley, the owner of the Melrose clothing store Off Chute Too, was forced to resign from the LGBTQ+ advisory board in 2017 after he spoke out about the department’s lack of transparency with hate crime statistics, its inconsistent meeting schedules, and its unwillingness to take feedback or suggestions from board and community members.\nAnd an ineffective liaison program is little better than none at all.\nWhat happens when liaisons fail?\nEven after Ron Blake finally gained the clarity and bravery to sit down with Det. Smith, he still had a hard time trusting police.\nYears passed without significant movement in his case or clear communication about what was going on. The updates he did receive were often riddled with inaccuracies, he said.\nIn 2023, he learned his case had been closed since 2021. s show that no one with Phoenix police — including the liaison assigned to his case — had informed him.\nDuring his long and ongoing quest for justice, Blake said the Arizona Coalition to End Sexual and Domestic Violence did what Phoenix police’s liaison should have been doing. The organization helped Blake get in touch with the Family Advocacy Center and set up a meeting with the Phoenix police brass to discuss making changes addressing LGBTQ+ bias and sexual assault cases.\nBlake said two police representatives verbally acknowledged that he was treated differently because he was gay and assured him that they would make changes. But as far as Blake knows, no changes were ever explored. LOOKOUT and New Times have reached out to the Phoenix police’s current LGBTQ+ liaisons, Dets. Gary Nelson and Trey Sueing, for information regarding Blake’s case as well as training information on their liaison program. They have not responded.\nIt’s not uncommon for organizations to step in when police fail. In 2023, Epona Rose was arrested for assault in Flagstaff after defending herself against a group of men who allegedly threatened and sexually harassed her while making transphobic remarks. LOOKOUT’s reporting showed that Flagstaff police continuously misgendered her and held her in a men’s jail. Despite multiple protests, Flagstaff’s liaison never got involved in the case nor publicly acknowledged any issues.\nFlagstaff Queer Collective was among the groups that rallied to Rose’s case. Ben Nicholas, the group’s director, said that Rose’s story was one reason the group was open to creating a relationship with Flagstaff police, which approached FQC in January as part of their efforts to develop their own Citizen Advisory Board.\nIn June 2024, new Flagstaff Police Chief Sean Connolly came on board and almost immediately began working to develop a Citizen Advisory Board similar to the one he had participated in during his time in Phoenix police. When asked about the critiques the department received about the police response to Epona Rose’s arrest, he said that he was not aware of it and would look into the situation. Notably, a member of Flagstaff Queer Collective told LOOKOUT and New Times that Connelly gave the same response to them two months earlier when the group pressed him on the subject.\nAccording to the department’s Public Information Officer Sgt. Jerry Rintala, the LGBTQ+ Citizen Advisory Board is scheduled to launch within the next 30 to 60 days. In the meantime, Connolly said he has continuously been building and maintaining connections with community members, including Flagstaff Queer Collective.\n“When we have these conversations, I want to hear of things that are collaborative and ways we can all generate safety and wellness,” Connolly said. “I’d be incredibly disappointed if (my department) was indifferent to an LGBTQ+ victim. There’s work to be done, and we know that.”\nThe queer community steps in when police don’t do their job, but what gaps exist when LGBTQ+ liaisons don’t exist to begin with?\nIt’s unclear exactly how many cities in Arizona do or don’t have LGBTQ+ liaisons. What is clear is that police responses to queer victims of crime, as well as their presence at certain events, aren’t always satisfactory.\nIn 2023, a gay couple in Queen Creek said the pride flag outside their home was repeatedly vandalized and that people screamed homophobic slurs at them. They filed two police reports, but still received a letter from their homeowner’s association restricting their flag from being displayed. Anti-LGBTQ+ graffiti was spray painted on neighborhood walls. The pair eventually moved for their safety.\nThe Queen Creek Police Department does not have an LGBTQ+ liaison. Neither does the Pinal County Sheriff’s Department, where portions of Queen Creek are located. Pinal County Sheriff’s Office Public Information Officer Sam Salzwedel told LOOKOUT and New Times they do not have a designated liaison for the LGBTQ+ community or any others because they “protect everybody in the county equally and do not believe in showing preferential treatment.”\nIn Cottonwood, a rural town in the Verde Valley region of Arizona, Proud Boys, Oathkeepers, and other white and Christian nationalist groups crashed a charity drag show event in Cottonwood, shouting slurs and leaving attendees on edge. Local organizers said police did nothing to intervene. Cottonwood’s department has a terrorism liaison, but not one for LGBTQ+ people.\nSuch incidents give queer residents pause.\nAccording to Greg Miraglia, a former law enforcement professional who co-founded Out to Protect, the nation’s only non-profit LGBTQ+ police liaison accreditation program, staffing community liaisons is a step toward ensuring equal protection under the law and building trust in law enforcement.\nBut until Miraglia began his program in 2023, police departments in Arizona and elsewhere lacked formal procedures for establishing an LGBTQ+ liaison. Agencies that choose to create liaison positions decide for themselves what they should do.\nAcross Arizona’s 10 largest cities with LGBTQ+ liaisons, it’s unclear what responsibilities, training or community practices they share, if any.\nThere are currently only five police departments in the U.S. with Out to Protect’s accreditation, which was created to fund LGBTQ+ liaison program training. Miraglia says every department that has applied has ultimately earned accreditation, which is granted upon receiving evidence of meeting the program’s six core standards, which include having a full-time liaison who is trained in the position, engaging with the community throughout the year and being a resource within the law enforcement agency.\nBy offering funded and affordable training programs, Miraglia hopes to eliminate cost as a barrier for departments weighing a LGBTQ+ liaison: “Cost just becomes an excuse for not doing it,” he said. “If (a department) simply doesn’t want to create a program, it’s easy for them to just say they can’t afford it.”\nSteps in the right direction\nThere is some hope for police relations with the LGBTQ+ community.\nFor the past few years, the Southern Arizona AIDS Foundation has provided “LGBTQ+ 101” training to the Tucson Police Department. In 2022, SAAF’s Anti-Violence Project partnered with the Pima County Attorney’s Office to provide LGBTQ+ victims of sexual assault with a dedicated queer-identifying victim advocate.\nThough the latter lasted only about a year, SAAF associate director of program services Emerson Kuhn said these initiatives from law enforcement and the county attorney’s office have helped build healthier relationships between LGBTQ+ community members and the law.\nThough SAAF has no data-based results from those trainings, Kuhn said Tucson police community engagement coordinator Margo Susco has been very proactive in keeping in contact with the local LGBTQ+ community. Tucson police lack an official LGBTQ+ liaison, though Susco said she and Assistant Chief Stacie Schaner fill some aspects of that role.\nSchaner said she’s been researching liaison programs and intends to explore the possibility of establishing one.\n“We’re very aware of how many barriers exist between law enforcement and LGBTQ+ victims of crime who feel like they can’t reach out, especially people of color,” Schaner said. “It’s important to start with internal initiatives, but I’d really like to explore how we can develop more external initiatives.”\nSuch initiatives are needed. Community organizers and nonprofits serving the queer community are pivotal advocates for ensuring justice and safety for LGBTQ+ Arizonans. But they can’t go it alone.\n“Police officers don’t always identify with the community, and that hinders our relationship,” said Joel Mills, a victim services specialist at the Arizona Coalition to End Sexual and Domestic Violence. “If there was a way to connect more and have a direct line, it’d be beneficial. Queer victims of domestic violence don’t always feel like services are for them. The tension between them and the police means they don’t always seek out resources, and police aren’t doing great at following up and giving resources.”\nThat rings true for Nate Rhoton and his team at One-n-Ten. As the CEO of such a large LGBTQ+ organization, he’d usually be aware of what resources police have dedicated to protect LGBTQ+ folks. But even he didn’t know who the existing Phoenix police LGBTQ+ liaisons were. It wasn’t until LOOKOUT and New Times contacted him for this piece that Rhoton decided to contact the office of Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego to find out.\nRhoton runs one of the more prominent LBGTQ+ advocacy organizations in the state, and he said Phoenix police liaisons haven’t reached out to introduce themselves.\n“If they’re wanting to develop trust, they have to hold the space and listen,” he said. “Our issues go back so long and are so embedded in the DNA of who we are as marginalized people that I don’t think one liaison or one conversation can fix all that. But it can start to develop trust one person at a time.”\nThis article was published with Phoenix New Times, an independent alt-weekly and digital media outlet serving the Valley since 1970.\nThis report was first published by the LOOKOUT.\nbreaking, rural, Lookout, news, politics & government, crime & safety, family/life, local, arizona,\nlgbtq, margo susco, pcao, pima county, police reform, stacie schaner, tpd\nBe a watchdog with us!\nUnlike most news outlets, the Tucson Sentinel publishes our stories without a paywall.

    "content": "Passover is a Jewish holiday remembering sorrowful events & celebrating hope for a better future\nPosted Apr 12, 2025, 8:40 am\nUniversity of Colorado Boulder/The Conversation\nApril Killingsworth/Flickr\nThe Haggadah is a guide to Passover’s central ritual, the Seder meal traditionally celebrated on the first and sometimes second evening.\nJewish families will gather for Passover this year in circumstances that will, like the celebration itself, reflect on dark times while looking ahead toward better ones to come.\nThe first two nights of the celebration involve a Seder, a ritual meal bringing together the family.\nAs a scholar of the Bible and ancient Judaism, I believe Passover is a particularly poignant time to recognize the tragedies of the past year and offer hope for the future.\nThe Passover is a festival found in the Bible that commemorates the escape of the Israelites, led by Moses, from Egypt as recounted in the book of Exodus. Prior to the departure of the enslaved Israelites, God delivered a series of plagues on Egypt, culminating in the killing of the firstborn son in every Egyptian family, including the firstborn of the livestock.\nThe Israelites, however, place the blood of a lamb on their doorposts to signal that the “destroyer,” an angel responsible for the killing, should skip, or pass over, those homes.\nThis story came to function as a powerful narrative of persecution and liberation for Jewish people. The command to celebrate and remember the exodus from Egypt and the Passover for future generations is encoded in the Bible itself: according to the book of Exodus, God commands Moses, even prior to their departure from Egypt, that the Israelites and their descendants are to commemorate this event.\nThe celebration of the Passover includes a script, called the Passover Haggadah. The Haggadah contains ancient rituals, some of which may have been practiced as early as the second century C.E., though the full script exists in later, medieval manuscripts.\nStory of the four sons\nToday, many families also create their own versions of the Haggadah, offering celebrations of the Passover that infuse personal and family experiences.\nEach member of the family plays certain roles, as found in the biblical story. This enactment of parts of the Exodus narrative fuses the present moment with the past, encouraging each participant to imagine themselves as part of the first generation to leave Egypt.\nSome characters not found explicitly in the biblical text were also added to the Haggadah script. Prominent among them is an addition from the ninth century C.E. – a story about the four sons or children - the wise, the wicked, the simple and the one who does not know what to ask.\nThe versions varied, but the characters became a prominent part of the celebration. In many families today, they are called “children” or “daughters,” allowing for the inclusion of all members of the family regardless of gender.\nThese characters were inspired by a variety of biblical and rabbinic sources in which children ask certain questions about the celebration of the Passover. In the case of the son who does not know what to ask, the parent directly tells the child about the importance of the exodus without waiting for the question.\nThe Bible speaks of interactions between parents and children, but does not label the children in a specific manner. The main purpose is telling, examining and passing on the significance of the exodus from a number of different perspectives. The distinct roles of each child encourage the participants to reflect, in different ways, on the significance of liberation and how to communicate it to future generations.\nAlmost like a time machine, then, the Haggadah and celebration of Passover incorporates the manner in which history, the present and the future relate to one another. This unfolding of all dimensions of time allows those who celebrate to remember tragedies and loss in the past while also generating a real sense of hope for the future.\nFlexibility and adaptation\nAccording to many parts of the Bible, the Passover festival was to occur once a year, and only in Jerusalem where the temple to the Israelite deity existed.\nThe celebration of Passover evolved into a home-based commemoration with the destruction of the temple by the Romans in C.E. 70. The biblical Passover mentioned in the book of Exodus also occurred in individual homes.\nAs such, the Bible provided ways to adapt the celebration in light of changed circumstances. The Bible describes how the second Passover – a year after the Israelites left Egypt – is celebrated in the wilderness, but seems to presuppose that its future celebration will be in the temple in Jerusalem. At that time, allowance would be made for those who had to travel long distances, by delaying its observance by 30 days.\nThis delay anticipated that geographical separation and time may not allow for normal Passover observance, a comfort directly derived from the Bible for those families who for whatever reason were not able to celebrate in person.\nWhen families gather for Passover, however, many may choose to reflect on the hard times of the past years as part of the Seder. Indeed, the celebration of the Passover has in it other references related to Jewish history, even if they were not always positive.\nFor example, part of the celebration of the Passover Haggadah entails the breaking of unleavened bread, a piece of which is known as the Afikomen, which is then hidden. Children try to find it for a prize, called a “treasure from Egypt.” The term Afikomen is itself a Greek word, referring possibly to after-dinner revelry. It is a reminder of another historical moment in which Jewish cultures were heavily surrounded and influenced by the Greeks.\nThe relationship with the Greeks was a complex one. Some part of the Greek influence was celebrated in early Jewish society. For example, the translation of the Old Testament from Hebrew into Greek, starting in the third century B.C.E., was considered a divine act.\nThere were also conflicts between Greek rulers and local Jewish populations, which led to a war in the second century B.C.E., known as the Maccabean Revolt. Indeed, there were debates in Judaism whether or not one could recite parts of the Bible in Greek, in worship services.\nYet the incorporation of the word Afikomen in the Passover Haggadah displays a willingness to borrow a Greek term into an important Jewish celebration.\nNext year in Jerusalem\nLooking to the future is central to the celebration of the Passover Haggadah. Despite the deliverance from slavery in Egypt, the meal concludes with the phrase, also said at the end of another observation known as Yom Kippur, “Next year in Jerusalem.”\nIn a meal that blends past and present and nods toward the future, ending the Haggadah with such a proclamation highlights the reality that despite freedom from Egypt, most Jewish communities over time celebrated the Passover Haggadah away from their ancestral home and in circumstances that were not ideal.\nThis yearning for a world that is not yet healed and the toggling between past, present and future in the Passover celebration will perhaps hold special significance for many families in light of the current conflicts in Israel.\nUpdate: This story has been updated.\nThis story originally appeared on The Conversation.\nAssociate Professor of Religious Studies and Jewish Studies, University of Colorado Boulder\nbreaking, The Conversation, news, politics & government, faith, family/life, opinion, analysis, nation/world,\nholidays, jews, passover\nBe a watchdog with us!\nUnlike most news outlets, the Tucson Sentinel publishes our stories without a paywall.

    "content": "Some measles response plans crash to a halt after Trump cuts\nCities & states battling disease outbreak feel undermined by administration\nPosted Apr 13, 2025, 9:38 am\nCities and states fighting a historic measles outbreak find themselves undermined by the Trump administration as they struggle to provide crucial vaccinations and overcome disinformation. As of this week, cases were nearing 650 in 22 states, on track to reach a 34-year high.\nA second unvaccinated child died of measles in West Texas last week. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended her funeral Sunday and called vaccination “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles” in a social media post.\nYet, as experts have noted, Kennedy has promoted vaccine skepticism and pitched alternatives such as cod liver oil and vitamin A to prevent measles — neither of which works. A top vaccine expert working under Kennedy resigned in protest.\nAbrupt cutoffs in federal funding under President Donald Trump have also crippled some state efforts to vaccinate people against measles and other diseases.\nA third death in New Mexico, of an unvaccinated adult who tested positive for measles, remains under investigation. Before vaccination started in 1963, measles caused as many as 500 deaths a year in the United States.\nThe most important things states can do are providing vaccine clinics, testing quickly for measles, and tracing the contacts of people with identified cases, as well as fighting misinformation on vaccines, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.\n“Measles is one of the most contagious diseases, so one of the roles of public health is working to identify others that might have been exposed,” Kansagra said of contract tracing.\nDespite vaccines’ effectiveness, recent federal funding halts have crippled state and local efforts to vaccinate more people not only for measles but also for this year’s deadly influenza viruses and COVID-19. On April 3, a federal judge in Rhode Island agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from pulling $11 billion in federal health grants from states after a court challenge by Democratic states.\nBut in the days before the judge’s order, measles response plans came to a crashing halt in parts of Minnesota, Texas and Washington state when federal health grants were abruptly cut off. Dozens of free vaccination clinics in the Dallas area were canceled overnight. On March 24, Washington state was forced to cancel 104 upcoming “Care-a-Van” mobile clinics that would have provided 2,000 vaccinations against childhood diseases, including measles.\nIn Minnesota, where $220 million in previously approved federal health funding was cut off, the state announced layoffs April 1, including some positions supporting measles vaccination and other disease response. Minneapolis vaccination clinics were canceled March 26.\n“The sudden and unexpected action from the federal government left us with no choice” but to lay off workers, Minnesota health commissioner Dr. Brooke Cunningham said in a statement. “We are working now to figure out how much of this critical public health work we can save and continue.”\nExperts regardless of political affiliation have expressed alarm about federal moves to abandon support for vaccines. They include the nation’s top vaccine expert at the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Peter Marks, who was appointed to the position in 2016.\nIn his resignation letter March 28, Marks said the measles outbreak “reminds us of what happens when confidence in well-established science underlying public health and well-being is undermined.” He accused Kennedy of seeking only “subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies” about vaccines in general.\nDr. Scott Gottlieb, who served as FDA commissioner in the first Trump administration and is now a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the measles outbreak could easily worsen and cost the United States its “eliminated” status, which was declared in 2000 based on the “absence of the continuous spread” of the disease.\n“I don’t think we’re headed into a good place,” Gottlieb said, speaking March 31 on CNBC. “He [Kennedy] has been very focused on dismantling components of the vaccine enterprise in this country.”\nMeasles is so contagious that it can spread to 90% of unvaccinated people near an infected person. The virus can linger in the air up to two hours after an infected person has coughed or sneezed. Symptoms of the disease include high fever, cough, runny nose and rash, leading to a severe lung infection. Rare severe cases can cause swelling of the brain and death. Measles is most dangerous for infants, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.\nIn Texas there are already signs that misinformation and vaccine skepticism may be feeding a rise in measles cases. The state had 499 cases as of April 6.\nA Lubbock hospital reported that several unvaccinated children were treated for vitamin A toxicity, apparently in response to Kennedy’s recommendations to take vitamin A and cod liver oil.\nDr. Ashish Jha, who worked on COVID-19 vaccine plans under the Biden administration, said vitamin A treatment is appropriate in parts of Africa where vitamin deficiency is a factor, but not often in the United States.\n“In Texas and Louisiana and New Mexico and Ohio and Pennsylvania, where we’re seeing a lot of these outbreaks, vitamin A is going to do very little for kids because they already have plenty of vitamin A,” Jha said.\n“Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to be vaccinated,” said Jha, who is now dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health.\nThe current outbreak is on track to surpass 2019, when there were nearly 1,300 cases, and to be the worst year for measles since 1991 when there were more than 9,600 cases.\nLocal and state health officials in Texas also warned against “measles parties” where people try to expose themselves and their children to the disease hoping to gain immunity. Measles can cause severe complications and death even in otherwise healthy people, state officials warned.\nNew Mexico has opened 22 free walk-in measles vaccine clinics around the state, including two in Lea County, where most of the cases are located, near the Texas border. The state is also trying to head off more infections in Guadalupe and Valencia counties, where a traveler from Texas may have exposed people to measles in early March at a restaurant, hotel, church and travel center.\nFunding cutbacks forced New Mexico to cancel contracts for vaccination outreach to potential clients in underserved communities, but the state has not interrupted its own public service messages or vaccine clinics, said New Mexico Department of Health spokesperson Robert Nott.\nKansas, where there are 24 known cases, recommended early vaccination for children in affected areas — starting at 6 months of age instead of the usual 1 year. The state also put doctors on alert to watch for symptoms such as fever and rash among unvaccinated people and offered expedited testing for suspected measles cases. Kentucky, with only one case, requires doctors to send such tests directly to the state for faster processing.\nAs in other states, almost all the Kansas cases are among unvaccinated people. Only one person with measles was fully vaccinated, and another case is not clear.\nColorado, where the state’s first case was reported March 31 in an unvaccinated Pueblo resident, state officials were already sending reminder texts and s about vaccination to parents because of cases in nearby Texas and New Mexico. They also warned residents who may have been exposed at a restaurant and clinic in Pueblo and Pueblo West in March.\nIn New Mexico, there’s been an encouraging increase in measles vaccinations since the outbreak, said Nott. There were almost 15,000 new vaccinations in February and March, up from about 8,200 in the same period last year, he said.\nOn April 2, New York state warned residents to get vaccinated before traveling to areas with measles outbreaks. In March, the Pan American Health Organization said measles outbreaks in North and South America could endanger the region’s status as “measles-free.”\nSome states are working to locate people who, residents or not, may have exposed others while traveling. New Jersey has three cases among residents, all members of one family, but is seeking people exposed to measles by travelers on an Amtrak train, at Newark Liberty International Airport, in hospitals and at other places in March.\nA March editorial in The Lancet, a medical journal, said the recent measles outbreaks “should be taken as a wakeup call” for more vaccinations.\n“People should be encouraged to listen to factual scientific evidence and verified sources. Awareness of the safety of the measles vaccine needs to be spread to combat the viral misinformation against it,” the editorial stated.\nStateline is a project of States Newsroom that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy.\nbreaking, Stateline, news, politics & government, crime & safety, family/life, health, media & journalism, sci/tech, nation/world,\ndonald trump, fda, measles, robert kennedy jr, vaccinations\nBe a watchdog with us!\nUnlike most news outlets, the Tucson Sentinel publishes our stories without a paywall.

    "content": "Legendary Tucson DJ 'Kidd Squidd' dead at 76\n'Mystery Jukebox' host David Squires remembered for 'commandeering the airwaves with such a gifted splendor'\nPosted Apr 9, 2025, 3:57 pm\nDave “Kidd Squidd” Squires, a radio disk jockey whose “Mystery Jukebox” program enraptured Tucson listeners on Saturday afternoons for decades, died Saturday, April 5. He was 76.\nSquires became a volunteer DJ at KXCI 91.3 FM shortly after the community radio station launched in late 1983 and continued crafting new episodes until the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak. His programs were rebroadcast every weekend through January 2022.\nHe was inducted into the Tucson Musicians Museum in 2022 and was voted Tucson’s Best DJ more than a dozen times by Tucson Weekly readers.\nTucson author and lecturer Gregory McNamee said Squires “lived and breathed for music.”\n“An untiring proselyte for century-and-more-old blues, stomping rockabilly, three-chords-and-the-truth country, sweaty zydeco, swinging New Orleans jazz, Sinatra and just about every other authentic expression of the soul through sound, music was Squidd’s religion, his love, his reason for being,” McNamee said. “All that music is still out there in the world, but who will tell us about it, insist we drop what we’re doing and listen to it in all its glorious variety, now that he’s slipped away across the universe?”\nSquires described the show as “all over the place,” with themes ranging from songs about motorcycles and UFOs to genres such as dreampop or country jukebox hits. Throughout each program, Squires would share his wealth of music history and trivia, often finding his unique connections between songs and genre.\n“A lot of times, he would put together shows that had an emotional core, a sonic theme, which would transcend different generations, different genres,” KXCI Music Director Duncan Hudson said. “It could be any kind of recorded music that had that emotional center. I think that's really rare in the presentation of music, certainly in the day of logarithms and AI that misses that human core of emotion. And Kidd was really tapped into that, the love of music and the power of music.”\nHowe Gelb of the Tucson band Giant Sand remembered Squires “commandeering the airwaves with such a gifted splendor and thorough appreciation of all that went into capturing music on disc and then cherishing to gift it to all those with an open ear and a heart in need of quench for the music that was always out meaning to find us, but couldn’t.”\n“Kidd would deliver the goods with such glee, like he was setting all turntable prisoners free,” Gelb wrote on .\nRialto Theatre Executive Director Cathy Rivers, who previously worked as the executive director of KXCI, said Squires \"considered himself sort of an ethnomusicologist,” Rivers said. “And I loved that. That's the way he saw himself, sharing his passion and his love and the research and the open heart and open mind that he had to all music, and giving that to the people.”\nRivers said she and Squires built an unlikely bond over a love of the Harry Potter books and they enjoyed attending a Tucson Symphony Orchestra production that included a screening of the first Potter film with a live performance of the soundtrack.\n“I was probably way too old to be exploring Harry Potter books and reading them at my age, but I think it really described Kidd,” Rivers said. “It was a true sense of who he was, filled with magic and wonder and open to all of that. We were the oldest kids in the audience that night.”\nThe Rialto Theatre's marquee this week thanked Squire \"for all the kool toonz.\"\nTucson musician Hank Topless said he’d “always recall being struck by how hard he worked, how much effort he invested in trying to give enjoyment to others. On top of that, he was just the nicest and classiest guy.”\nBorn in 1948, Squires grew up in Illinois and played basketball in high school until he heard the early R&B of the Rolling Stones.\nHe was hooked for life.\nAfter he graduated high school, Squires hitchhiked his way across the USA, passing through New Orleans and Los Angeles, where he saw his first rock concert, Buffalo Springfield, at the famed Whiskey a Go-Go. His travels took him north to San Francisco, where he lived during the legendary Summer of Love in 1967, in an apartment at the corner of Haight and Ashbury, the symbolic center of the counter-cultural revolution.\nBut the scene eventually soured for him – “speed freaks and Hell’s Angels and all that,” Squires said – and he left the Bay Area.\nWhile studying transcendental meditation in Iowa, he had an epiphany: Music was the most important thing in his life.\n\"The more I looked into it, the more I got out of it,\" he told Tucson Weekly in 2003. \"It was enriching, and that was when I started to realize that no music is an island unto itself; it's all linked and all like a fabric that's been stitched together or a river of music. It continues to become more and more fascinating to me.\"\nHe ended up living in Southern California and adopted the moniker Juke Joint Dave. In the winter of 1983, his brother, Mike Squires, sent him a flyer about a new community radio station that was on the verge of launching and was looking for DJs.\n“He immediately moved here,” Mike Squires said. “It was that quick.”\nTucson photographer Michael Hyatt credited Squires with luring him to Tucson. They’d met at a record-listening party in California and bonded over their love of music.\n“He was very enthusiastic about sharing American music and The Rolling Stones, of course,” Hyatt said. “It just bubbled up constantly on the air, how much he loved his music and how much he wanted to share with with the world. And he was very good at it … He found his calling, and that was it.\"\nSquires retired from the show in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak because he feared getting vaccinated, which was required of KXCI staff and volunteers.\n“He was a little bit set in his ways with certain things and that was one of them,” Hyatt said.\nSquires spent the last decade of his life in assisted living at St. Luke’s Home. His brother remembers he started running the movie night there.\n“At the end, he played a movie five nights a week,” said Mike Squires. “Always the entertainer.”\nSquires suffered from diabetes and experienced complications from the disease in his later years. “He got an infection in his foot, got sepsis, and that’s what started it all,” Mike Squires said. “In the end, his liver went and when that happened, it went real quick.”\nHyatt said that Squires was at peace in his final days.\n“He told me that he wasn’t afraid,” Hyatt said. “He was looking forward to what’s on the other side.”\nMike Squires still has his brother’s belongings in storage – “a few clothes, all kinds of music books and his CDs and movies, that what he had in his possession when he left this planet” – and plans to give it all away sometime in the fall.\n“I'm going to do a memorial in October with all of his books and CDs,” Mike Squires said. “I want to give them all away. We’ll go out to Himmel Park or something.”\nJim Nintzel is TucsonSentinel.com’s Government & Political Impact reporter, and a veteran Report for America corps member supported by readers like you.\narts & culture, entertainment, celebs/pop culture, music, breaking, family/life, media & journalism, history,\ncathy rivers, duncan hudson, hank topless, howe gelb, kxci, obituaries\nBe a watchdog with us!\nUnlike most news outlets, the Tucson Sentinel publishes our stories without a paywall.

    "content": "About the Tucson Sentinel: Our mission\nWe learn from & inform Southern Arizonans about the community challenges & unique culture of our Borderlands\nTucson Sentinel's independent nonprofit newsroom is an award-winning journalism pioneer that learns from & informs Southern Arizonans about the community challenges & unique culture of our Borderlands: \"A smarter Tucson is a better Tucson.\"\nThrough watchdog reporting, local commentary & expert analysis, the Sentinel inspires residents to be meaningfully engaged with our community, promotes transparency & understanding, seeks solutions that empower, & holds the powerful accountable.\nThe Tucson Sentinel is the only locally owned source for independent watchdog reporting focused squarely on our community — we're an award-winning nonprofit newsroom that's supported by people who back our mission of deep, authentic journalism that reflects Tucson and Southern Arizona.\nIn our 15th year of full-time publishing, the Sentinel has a growing reputation — both locally and nationally — for providing high-quality, balanced reporting on Southern Arizona.\nA smarter Tucson is a better Tucson: The ultimate goal of the Tucson Sentinel is to play our role in creating a more informed community that is making wiser choices. A more immediate goal is to moderate rhetoric and foster a respectful dialogue about local and regional issues through solid, reliable accountability journalism.\nWe’re local, independent and nonprofit. We care about our community and invest our resources back into robust reporting. We maintain professional news standards and provide even-handed, honest journalism.\nThe Tucson Sentinel, published by the 501c3 nonprofit Tucson Investigative Reporting Center Inc., is part of the vanguard of Local Independent Online News Publishers, a member of the prestigious Institute for Nonprofit News, and has gained a national reputation for delivering solid, hard-hitting local news. Since our launch, we've posted more than 40,000 stories.\nOur work has been referenced by everyone from Maddow to Breitbart, including ABC, NBC, Radio Melbourne, Sirius, Fox News, MSNBC, NPR, the Guardian, the New York Times and many more. We've worked with CBS News and the (UK) Telegraph, and other news outlets around the country and around the world. USA Today, Agence France Presse and many others in the industry press have written about us as a pioneering startup nonprofit news outlet.\nDon't just take our word for it: Here's what a few of our readers have told us:\n\"Our nation would be in much better shape if more media outlets took the time to find the facts and report them as you do.\" — T.E.\n\"Everybody in the country is chasing TucsonSentinel.com again.\" — B.P.\n\"TucsonSentinel.com has been spot-on this entire time.\" — J.H.\n\"High five for your reporting efforts. You've been doing one hell of a job.\" — J.L.\n\"You have done a great job covering this story in a respectful and thorough - yes, that's what journalism is supposed to be - manner. Thank you.\" — J.E.\n\"Big news, and the Sentinel's there first. (Again.)\" — L.K.\n\"@TucsonSentinel is the only truly independent news source in Southern AZ for news.\" — T.T.\n\"Extremely tough but fair and well-done; another first-class piece of journalism.\" — PC\n\"Thank you Tucson Sentinel - you have done the best job on this story. I now know what news source to trust the most in Tucson. \" — D.G.\n\"The Sentinel wins another local reporting contest. Though they didn’t get the story out first, the Sentinel's piece was far more informative, detailed, and lucid then that of its competitors.\" - B.L.\n\"Gotta give credit, Dylan Smith at the Tucson Sentinel provides the best political coverage in town .... All the publications have talent, but by far the editorial decisions nod goes to Dylan, and it ain't close.\" — T.H.\n\"Tucson Sentinel, I love and deeply respect your coverage of the real news in our good Old Pueblo. Tucson rocks and so do you. Your reporting of Gabby's progress gets a tear from me nearly every post. Your journalism has heart, courage and lots and lots of love for our beautiful city.\" — B.V.\n\"I want you to continue and thrive. I'm telling everyone I know about TucsonSentinel.com.\" — J.O.\nWhy is your support so important? The Tucson Sentinel is still a bootstrapped startup, part of a nationwide movement that's returning local news to its roots while leveraging new technology to effectively and efficiently create informed communities.\nSadly, the free press here in Tucson is threatened. We have very few news organizations that are actually locally owned and operated. Most are controlled by out-of-state corporations, who have laid off reporters and photographers, and cut, and cut again. While we have many talented colleagues committing journalism at news outlets in Tucson, it's a fact that there are hundreds fewer reporters in this city than there were a decade ago.\nInstead, there are more public relations operatives for corporations, political organizations, and yes, for government.\nWhat we need are more watchdogs, sniffing out the truth — and that's why the Tucson Sentinel began publishing 15 years ago. We don't back political candidates or causes, but relentlessly champion the truth — and nothing but. We clearly disclose our sources of funding, and don't allow underwriters or donors to sway our coverage. We uphold the time-honored ethics of professional journalism, mindful of a tradition of dedication and with an an eye to the innovative future.\nWhile we're a nonprofit, what we really are is a mission-driven organization: we work to provide people with news that's clear, comprehensive, concise, compelling, and demonstrates how much we care for this city we call home.\nOur editors are among the founders of LION: Local Independent Online News Publishers, a national network representing local indie online news websites, who are successfully creating the future of reporting: locally owned and operated news outlets that directly serve their communities. Sentinel Editor and Publisher Dylan Smith is the founding chairman of LION Publishers.\nAt the TucsonSentinel, we believe strongly in local independent online news.\nWe're LOCAL: News about Tucson should be reported by journalists who know Southern Arizona. National and chain-owned news groups don't have the background to put our local news into context. Our reporters and editors are here, our nonprofit organization is headquartered here, and our longterm success depends on Tucson's success in being an informed community that makes wise decisions. We don't just report on Tucson, we live here and love our community.\nWe're INDEPENDENT: Too much of what gets called \"journalism\" is motivated by political viewpoints. At the Sentinel, we're nonpartisan: our only agenda is the truth. In doing the hard work to give you independent news without the spin, we dedicate ourselves to solid reporting that tells you like it is. We're not part of a national chain of cookie-cutter outlets, with news decisions dictated from some shiny HQ in another state. Our reporting reflects what Tucsonans want and need to know. And rather than padding the profits of an out-of-town corporation, all of our revenues are invested in our growing news organization.\nWe're ONLINE: TucsonSentinel.com leverages the power of the Internet to bring you as it happens, and in-depth investigative reports on important issues. We innovate in our work, and host a respectful online community conversation on the issues.\nWe're NEWS: You can find photo galleries of cheerleaders all over the Internet. Whether it's bringing you the news before its history, providing long-form reporting or working with our national investigative journalism partners, we deliver insightful reporting that's relevant to readers in Southern Arizona, and allows the rest of the world to see the borderlands through the eyes of those who live here.\nJournalism is an vital public service in a free and democratic society. Investigative reporting uncovers injustice, exposes corruption and holds officials accountable. Community reporting celebrates the unique nature of Tucson's people and culture, reflecting our sense of place through a knowing lens.\nWe aim to provide both: to point out the things we all love about Southern Arizona, and point to possible solutions for what needs changing. We believe that just as an unexamined life is not worth living, an unexamined city is not worth living in. A metropolitan area of 1 million people deserves a vital and sustainable source of news. We aim to be that watchdog.",

    "content": "Federal judge clears way for ICE raids at churches\nDonald Trump appointee found the coalition of 27 Christian & Jewish groups lacked standing, failed to offer evidence that any such raids are happening\nPosted Apr 11, 2025, 2:13 pm\nPaul Ingram/TucsonSentinel.com\nThe faith organizations argued they were clearly harmed by the marked decrease in attendance they’ve suffered since the new policy was announced.\nA federal judge on Friday denied a multifaith coalition’s request to block a Trump administration policy reversal that allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to freely enter places of worship to arrest migrants.\nU.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich, a Donald Trump appointee, wrote in her opinion that the coalition of 27 Christian and Jewish groups failed to show they had standing to challenge the rule reversal, which lifted the high bar needed to justify raids on churches, schools, medical facilities or day care centers.\nThe former rule, part of a long-standing “sensitive locations” policy, prevented ICE and Customs and Border Protection agents from going into places of worship unless under “exigent circumstances” or without high-level approval.\nOn Jan. 20, the department rescinded the sensitive locations policy and wrote in a memo that any “bright-line rules” about where rules could be enforced were unnecessary. The department directed ICE and CBP officers to “use discretion along with a healthy dose of common sense.\"\n“Absent evidence of specific directives to immigration officers to target plaintiffs’ places of worship, or a pattern of enforcement actions, the court finds no credible threat of imminent enforcement,” Friedrich wrote, characterizing the suit as a “pre-enforcement challenge.”\nThe faith organizations argued they were clearly harmed by the marked decrease in attendance they’ve suffered since the new policy was announced.\nOne largely Hispanic congregation reported a decrease in attendance to weekly worship services from approximately 140 to 90 people, while another Spanish-speaking congregation reported drops by 25-40% since January.\nFriedrich did not contest that the drops amounted to an injury, but doubted the plaintiffs could prove a direct tie to the policy reversal.\n“At least on the existing record, the plaintiffs have not presented ‘substantial evidence’ that the policy recission — as opposed to the administration’s broader immigration crackdown — has caused widespread congregant absences from religious services,” Friedrich said. “The evidence suggests that congregants are staying home to avoid encountering ICE in their own neighborhoods, not because churches or synagogues are locations of elevated risk.”\nIn their suit, the coalition highlighted the Jan. 31 arrest of a Honduran immigrant named Wilson Velásquez during a church service in Georgia.\nHe traveled to the U.S. with his wife and three children in 2022; they turned themselves in to request asylum immediately after crossing the border. They were given a court date and released after immigration officers attached an ankle monitor to Velásquez.\nThe family settled near Atlanta and attended services at a Pentecostal church several times a week, helping with music. When the agents arrived, Velásquez had attended all his required check-ins at an Atlanta ICE office and had a court date to present his asylum case to a judge.\nDespite that, the ICE agents arrested him, saying they were “looking for people with ankle bracelets.”\nThe coalition argued that the policy reversal forced their congregations to make a “Hobson’s choice” between ending their practice of welcoming anyone into their doors or making them an easy target for immigration officers, either of which would violate their religious freedom.\nFriedrich again found that the record did not support any assumption that the places of worship would be targets for raids and is thus too speculative to grant them standing in the case.\nFriedrich suggested during a hearing last week that she doubted there was enough evidence in the case that would allow her to grant the coalition’s requested preliminary injunction.\nKelsi Corkran of the Georgetown Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection argued on April 4 that the record was so limited because of the pending litigation challenging the rule reversal both in Washington and in Maryland, brought by a Quaker coalition on Jan. 27.\nU.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang in Maryland granted a preliminary injunction for the Quaker's specific plaintiffs on Feb. 24.\n“The Department of Homeland Security is currently under this mass deportation mandate, so I think CBP are getting as many people as possible, but they’re focusing on the low-hanging fruit, people with ankle monitors, people who are coming in for their asylum check-ins,” Corkran said.\nJustice Department attorney Kristina Wolfe argued on April 4 that the Trump administration had a compelling interest to “uniformly” enforce the nation’s immigration laws, as directed by Congress. She added that the plaintiff’s speculation made a denial the easy choice.\n“They have pointed to nothing in the record that demonstrates the conduct they seem to be concerned about, with ICE agents or CBP agents rolling up to a place of worship during services and storming into the sanctuary, yanking people out to question them about their immigration status,” Wolfe said.\nbreaking, Courthouse News Service, news, politics & government, border, crime & safety, faith, local, arizona, nation/world,\n, cpb, deportation, domestic violence, donald trump, ice, immigration\nBe a watchdog with us!\nUnlike most news outlets, the Tucson Sentinel publishes our stories without a paywall.

Their dismissal mirrored others across HHS, which came without warning and left officials puzzled as to why they were “RIF’ed” — as in “reduction in force,” the bureaucratic language used to describe the firings.\n“I suspect they RIF’ed offices that had the word ‘data’ or ‘statistics’ in them,” said one of the laid-off employees, a social scientist whom KFF Health News agreed not to name because the person feared further recrimination. “It was random, as far as we can tell.”\nAmong those fired was Kendall Swenson, who had led development of the poverty guidelines for many years and was considered the repository of knowledge on the issue, according to the social scientist and two academics who have worked with the HHS team.\nThe sacking of the office could lead to cuts in assistance to low-income families next year unless the Trump administration restores the positions or moves its duties elsewhere, said Robin Ghertner, the fired director of the Division of Data and Technical Analysis, which had overseen the guidelines.\nThe poverty guidelines are “needed by many people and programs,” said Timothy Smeeding, a professor emeritus of economics at the La Follette School of Public Affairs at the University of Wisconsin. “If you’re thinking of someone you fired who should be rehired, Swenson would be a no-brainer,” he added.\nUnder a 1981 appropriations bill, HHS is required annually to take Census Bureau poverty-line figures, adjust them for inflation, and create guidelines that agencies and states use to determine who is eligible for various types of help.\nThere’s a special sauce for creating the guidelines that includes adjustments and calculations, Ghertner said. Swenson and three other staff members would independently prepare the numbers and quality-check them together before they were issued each January.\nEveryone in Ghertner’s office was told last week, without warning, that they were being put on administrative leave until June 1, when their employment would officially end, he said.\n“There’s literally no one in the government who knows how to calculate the guidelines,” he said. “And because we’re all locked out of our computers, we can’t teach anyone how to calculate them.”\nASPE had about 140 staff members and now has about 40, according to a former staffer. The HHS shake-up merged the office with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ, whose staff has shrunk from 275 to about 80, according to a former AHRQ official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\nHHS has said it laid off about 10,000 employees and that, combined with other moves, including a program to encourage early retirements, its workforce has been reduced by about 20,000. But the agency has not detailed where it made the cuts or identified specific employees it fired.\n“These workers were told they couldn’t come into their offices so there’s no transfer of knowledge,” said Wendell Primus, who worked at ASPE during the Bill Clinton administration. “They had no time to train anyone, transfer data, etc.”\nHHS defended the firings. The department merged AHRQ and ASPE “as part of Secretary Kennedy’s vision to streamline HHS to better serve Americans,” spokesperson Emily Hilliard said. “Critical programs within ASPE will continue in this new office” and “HHS will continue to comply with statutory requirements,” she said in a written response to KFF Health News.\nAfter this article published, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon called KFF Health News to say others at HHS could do the work of the RIF’ed data analysis team, which had nine members. “The idea that this will come to a halt is totally incorrect,” he said. “Eighty million people will not be affected.”\nSecretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has so far declined to testify about the staff reductions before congressional committees that oversee much of his agency. On April 9, a delegation of 10 Democratic members of Congress waited fruitlessly for a meeting in the agency’s lobby.\nThe group was led by House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee ranking member Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), who told reporters afterward that Kennedy must appear before the committee “and tell us what his plan is for keeping America healthy and for stopping these devastating cuts.”\nMatt VanHyfte, a spokesperson for the Republican committee leadership, said HHS officials would meet with bipartisan committee staff on April 11 to discuss the firings and other policy issues.\nASPE serves as a think tank for the HHS secretary, said Primus, who later was Rep. Nancy Pelosi’s senior health policy adviser for 18 years. In addition to the poverty guidelines, the office maps out how much Medicaid money goes to each state and reviews all regulations developed by HHS agencies.\n“These HHS staffing cuts — 20,000 — obviously they are completely nuts,” Primus said. “These were not decisions made by Kennedy or staff at HHS. They are being made at the White House. There’s no rhyme or reasons to what they’re doing.”\nHHS leaders may be unaware of their legal duty to issue the poverty guidelines, Ghertner said. If each state and federal government agency instead sets guidelines on its own, it could create inequities and lead to lawsuits, he said.\nAnd sticking with the 2025 standard next year could put benefits for hundreds of thousands of Americans at risk, Ghertner said. The current poverty level is $15,650 for a single person and $32,150 for a family of four.\n“If you make $30,000 and have three kids, say, and next year you make $31,000 but prices have gone up 7%, suddenly your $31,000 doesn’t buy you the same,” he said, “but if the guidelines haven’t increased, you might be no longer eligible for Medicaid.”\nThe 2025 poverty level for a family of five is $37,650.\nAs of October, about 79 million people were enrolled in Medicaid or the related Children’s Health Insurance Program, both of which are means-tested and thus depend on the poverty guidelines to determine eligibility.\nEligibility for premium subsidies for insurance plans sold in Affordable Care Act marketplaces is also tied to the official poverty level.\nOne in eight Americans rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, and 40% of newborns and their mothers receive food through the Women, Infants, and Children program, both of which also use the federal poverty level to determine eligibility.\nFormer employees in the office said they were not disloyal to the president. They knew their jobs required them to follow the administration’s objectives. “We were trying to support the MAHA agenda,” the social scientist said, referring to Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy Again” rubric. “Even if it didn’t align with our personal worldviews, we wanted to be useful.”\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent news service.

    "title": "The solid one: Richard Fimbres leaves Tucson City Council better than he found it",
    "content": "What the Devil won't tell you\nThe solid one: Richard Fimbres leaves Tucson City Council better than he found it\nPosted Apr 11, 2025, 5:09 pm\nRichard Fimbres has been a good guy who likes public service.\nSometimes it doesn't have to be more complicated than that.\nFimbres has announced that he will step down on May 1 after nearly 16 years on the City Council.\nHis health had been failing. He had stopped attending meetings in person but beamed in remotely from his South Side office. He could be seen pushing a wheeled walker across the camera frame. I point this out because he was really, really trying to get back to being ship-shape.\nIn a brief letter of resignation Friday, Fimbres said: \"I had hoped to complete my current term of office, but I need to turn my full attention to my family and my health.\"\nGood on him. It must not be easy for a big, strong guy like Fimbres to make the decision to walk away.\nFimbres was elected during the last hard year for Democrats. It was 2009. That's when I interacted with him the most, which was not that much because Fimbres generally acted like he had little to no interest in politics.\nAnd I mean that in kind of a good way.\nThere was a lot of behind the scenes stuff going on in 2009. Incumbents Nina Trasoff and Karin Uhlich were not, shall I say, happy with each other over a decision to fire City Manager Mike Hein.\nThey were also running scared. Consternation gripped the back rooms of Pima County that year because Rio Nuevo was showing few results other than \"green shoots.\" That's not a lot for a Downtown revitalization project that had been approved a decade before.\nThere was a ballot proposition to essentially cede both city and county general funds to cops. The Dems thought it was bad but (being Dems) didn't think they could win a fight against the police. So that was starting fires in the ranks.\nThe Tea Party was ascendant and had their first crack at campaigning and voting against anyone with \"D\" next to their name.\nProgressives figured everything was fixed because Barack Obama was president or they were totally irate that single-payer health care had been jettisoned for what became \"Obamacare.\"\nWhen one side is on fire, the other side is asleep and the middle is angry about an issue like Rio Nuevo, anyone can beat anyone.\nThere was this absolute nobody running against Trasoff – a guy named Steve Koza Koza .. don't worry about him KOZA he's not going anywhere. Ha. Ha. Ha. Kozachik also recently left the Council after building himself into a local juggernaut.\nUhlich had her hands full with Ben Buehler-Garcia, an amiable Republican who was big in the veteran community. He lost by just more than 200 votes.\nFimbres was seeking the open seat left by Steve Leal's retirement. His opponent had to be found through making robocalls. Even so, Shaun McClusky proved a worthy foe and only lost by five points.\nI have long believed that Fimbres won that race in the years before he ran, when he had established strong connections with his part of town in efforts that once won him the Tucson Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce's Person of the Year.\nFimbres kinda floated above politics. Party headquarters were jam-packed with deep discussions and occasional shouting matches about high-minded political theories.\nHis attitude was \"Yeah, OK. I'm just going to talk to voters. I'll leave the strategery to you guys.\" While many of us planned world domination, he just went out and won an election.\nI think it came from being a cop. Fimbres was a 32-year veteran of the Pima County Sheriff's Department and went on to serve as Gov. Janet Napolitano's head of the Office of Highway Safety. Commissioned law enforcement officers are supposed to maintain an even keel and remain in control of situations.\nHe also had a run on the Pima Community College District Governing Board and that's not a place an aspiring politician goes if they are thinking about white houses and big jets stamped \"United States of America\" across the side.\nFimbres was never a guy like that.\nHe was just a Buddha-type during those harrowing days. When he walked in the room, people were happy to see him. When he left, they wished him well. There was no behind the back eyerolling with Fimbres.\nHe just worked and did the job as a candidate and then as a City Council member.\nHe was neither a visionary nor an obstacle to progress. He took care of his South Side ward as best he could.\nSometimes what your voters need is a store.\nFimbres is a lifelong resident of Ward 5.\nThe thing about the South Side isn't that it's deeply impoverished. It's that there are no services and by \"services\" I mean places to buy food or lawn furniture or clothes for your kids.\nSo Fimbres and the city worked to help develop The Bridges, along 36th Street between South Park Avenue and South Kino Parkway.\nIt's 350 acres of retail and residential development that got final approval in 2018. There's a Costco, a Walmart and more retail coming in, and City Manager Timothy Thomure said he was instrumental in bringing it online.\nIt doesn't seem like much unless one doesn't have access to this kind of thing. So, like, when some idiot columnist writes about how the project is wrongly giving sales tax breaks to the businesses going in there, maybe it's because he lives a six-iron shot from two grocery stores, 18 restaurants and 56 retail outlets. What a spoiled freaking brat.\nMayor Regina Romero credited Fimbres with starting the Homeless Work Program, a public private partnership that has put hundreds of people to work because that's what guys with empathy do. He helped lead the way on the Santa Rita Master Plan and fought to keep the Cherrybell Post Office open.\nThat right there. Little things. That matter to people.\nIn this time when it's in vogue to believe everyone in public office is a crook, a creep or a careerist, it's important to remember that most people who win office really care about what they say they care about. That's why I savage those who don't, because they are rare.\nThe word that keeps occurring to me when I think of Richard Fimbers is \"solid.\" He's the neighbor you can call at 4 in the morning when the car stops running. He's the guy who will bring back the tools he borrows.\nI don't know if it's a one-to-one thing but I'll give him a little bit of credit here. Over time, a manic Council took on his even strain. It's a far more mature governing body today than when he took his seat on it.\nFimbres is leaving the Council but he's leaving it better than he found it.\nEver the cop, he protected and served.\nBlake Morlock is an award-winning columnist who worked in daily journalism for more than 25 years and is the former communications director for the Pima County Democratic Party.

    "content": "Pima Supes to pick new member; Oro Valley seeks changes to town center\nFEMA letter further threatens clawbacks at Pima County; Santa Cruz appointing new judges + more in local gov't meetings\nPosted Apr 13, 2025, 2:57 pm\nCandidates to fill Adelita Grijalva's District 5 seat on the Board of Supervisors take part in a remote forum ahead of the April 15 vote for a successor.\nFormer state Rep. Andrés Cano seems like the frontrunner for the District 5 seat on the Pima County Board of Supervisors — but beware frontrunner status. Plus: Oro Valley looks to change up its planned town center, new Santa Cruz judges and more from government meetings around Tucson this week.\nThe Pima County Board of Supervisors is moving fast to replace Adelita Graijalva, who stepped down to seek her father's seat in Congress.\nSix applicants have thrown in their lots to sit on the board, which is a pretty cushy gig at an annual salary of more than $96,000.\nThe smart money is on former state lawmaker Andrés Cano. He's worked in the District 5 office, under former Supervisor Richard Elías. He's been a player in Tucson politics, trying to establish a new progressive power center representing a new generation of leaders. He's done time at Harvard University.\nHe's been an up-and-comer for a while, and maybe it's time for him to take his place among leadership in Tucson.\nPima Community College Governing Boardmember Karla Morales looks like a dark horse if Cano can't get the votes.\nA word of caution to the \"smart money.\" Actually, two names of caution: Elías and Ray Carroll.\nElías wasn't in anyone's top tier of candidates to replace Raúl Grijalva when the former supervisor declared his run for Congress. Elías ran the county's housing department. Yet he delivered a table-pounding, impassioned speech on behalf of the working class and found himself on the Board.\nSalomon Baldenegro, an old Grijalva ally, had seemed like the natural fit. It didn't go that way.\nCarroll was a whole different matter. He was seeking to replace John Even, who died in office. Even's widow, Brenda, sought to replace him. She had been Tucson Unified School District's Governing Board president. It wasn't a crazy idea.\nExcept, Grijlava nominated Carroll. There was a 2-2 vote on the board and it was broken by then Clerk of the Board Lori Godoshian — and thus Carroll was on the board. The local Republican Party threw a hissy fit. No, it was serious. Carroll appointed his old friend Scott Egan as his staff guy and Egan had been a member of the Communist Party but you gotta know Egan. He can at once be a Democratic Socialist and an old school Tea Party Republican and he somehow makes it work. It's an Irish thing.\nEventually, Sugar Ray won over the GOP and even charmed the Democrats.\nJust remember the old wisdom about papal succession: He who enters the conclave a pope, leaves a cardinal. Each supervisor can have their favorite candidate but none get to three votes. So the obvious candidates can be eliminated in a game of \"Screw my person? No, screw your person.\"\nSo don't sleep on engineer Cynthia Abril Sosa Ontiveros, retired teacher Lewis David Araiza, Sr., county employee Kimberly Baeza or retiree Richard Hernandez.\nRaul Grijalva's death prompted the vacancy. His daughter, Adelita Grijalva had held her dad's old Pima seat and resigned to take a shot at his congressional one.\nAfter the vote to fill the District 5 seat, the plan is for the winning candidate to be immediately sworn into office and take the dais during the meeting.\nA final thought, here. The last two times a seat came up to be filled, supervisors asked that the applicants commit to not seeking a full term. The board has no such demand this time.\nVoters are the only people who should be able to confer the advantages of incumbency to any county officer.\nWe don't want to go back to the time when the supervisors picked the three of five board members and half the row officers. That's the voters' job.\nMom & dad are yelling again\nThe Tucson City Council approved a notice of intent to raise water rates by hiking the price charged to county residents who get city-supplied drinking water.\nHere we go again. Mom and Dad are arguing.\nThe county hates this idea and will vote on a resolution condemning the hike. In fact, the county resolution includes 13 \"WHEREASes,\" just to enumerate all the reasons they are angry before the resolution gets to \"be it resolved.\"\nIn 2021, the city tried it and the county sued. A Maricopa County judge ruled the city didn't base the new rate on any hard evidence, so the Council put their shoulders into a big study, which justified raising rates now even more than they tried to do four years ago.\nThe city police are fine in a vacuum. I mean, cities are far better equipped than county governments at providing urban services. It's smart to do things like differential water rates to encourage annexation.\nIt just really makes the county mad. Is it worth it? I was under the impression that the water delivery system was doing OK. It was doing OK during a western drought. And we live in the desert, not known for high water tables and flowing rivers, streams, creaks and brooks.\nSo why is the city doing this? Sometimes I think the city and county do things to one another with joy in their hearts about how much it peeves the other side. All city voters are county voters. More than half of all county voters are city voters.\nAt the same time, the Board of Supervisors forgets that if the current pricing scheme is bad for city voters, it's bad for their voters too.\nI just sigh and shake my head.\nHow dare they try to fix a problem ...\nCounty Administrator Jan Lesher wants to discuss with the board an April 1 letter from the Federal Emergency Management Agency warning that the Trump administration may try to claw back money spent on asylum seekers.\nThe feds lay out how the county is expected to shut down the programs (set up to help stem issues created by the feds themselves) and seeing as there are none right now, there's no program.\nThe problem is with the attitude FEMA is taking and the threat of demanding money back. The letter gets hostile:\n\"As part of its review, FEMA will determine the final allowable costs for your awards. This will include evaluating whether all submitted costs incurred before the date of the Remedy of Noncompliance Letter are necessary, allocable, and reasonable. FEMA will notify you of the final allowable costs for the awards and, if the payments made exceed the final allowable costs, you will need to promptly refund the difference.\"\nOK. The county won't say it but I will.\nDonald Trump created the problem when he demanded Republicans vote against a Senate compromise that would have addressed a bunch of border issues. What's more, the failure of the federal government to honestly address immigration made the issue worse.\nLocal governments needed money from the feds because immigration is a federal issue Congress has enjoyed ignoring.\nSo what's this crap about the local government legally spending money on matters that were appropriated by Congress only to have the next administration come and say \"How dare you spend money on migrants we hate and do it before we took power.\"\nSee? That's how stuff works. Congress and a president give local governments money to address problems (wouldn't want federal \"Deep State globalists\" involved) and local government spends according to the rules set down by the people in charge.\nWhat team Trump is saying is \"You should have anticipated our victory and begun operating as xenophobic as we want to be.\" But under that logic, Lesher and the county should right now begin preparing for the incoming President Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez administration and ignore the orange guy's. Or, or, they should consider what President-elect Barron Trump may demand in 2041. Maybe what they should really do is prepare for the coming Large Language Model virtual presidency in 2052.\nLocal governments deal with who's in charge at any given time.\nThe Trump move makes absolutely no sense.\nThe county was supposed to just let migrants wander the streets of Tucson, coming in at 1,000 per day, so the voting public would hate asylum seekers even more. The problem had to be a crisis to justify the eventual stripping of due process rights from anyone with a Spanish last name.\nBy handling the problem and preventing a local crisis, Lesher interfered with the Trumpist hatred of legal asylum seekers and is what? Guilty of treason?\nThe county can't really say all that because they are looking for federal money elsewhere.\nFor instance, supervisors will also vote on submitting a consolidated action plan to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nThey are seeking $2.8 million in federal grants to fund numerous projects. Each are for small-ball amounts measured in thousands, with most in the tens of thousands.\nFor instance, Habitat for Humanity is up for $100,000. The YWCA of Southern Arizona is requesting $142,335 to run things like the Teen Court.\nThe idea has always been that nonprofit groups can more smartly direct funds than government bureaucracies. It's worth pointing out that when these charities get the money, they are derided as corrupt non-governmental organizations and when the government helps people out, it's bloat, waste, fraud and abuse.\nLesher will also be discussing the fiscal year 2025-26 county budget with the board, and I wish her good luck with that.\nAs I pointed out earlier this week, no one knows if the country is sliding into a recession, a slow down or a Golden Age (willing to bet against that last one). The point is, revenue projections are a big, fat mystery. How the hell is anyone supposed to budget?\nThe Tucson City Council was kind of all over the board during their budget discussions. They are part pretending nothing is happening, and part expecting a 2007-style fall-off in revenues.\nProperty taxes fund the county and they don't tend to fluctuate as much as sales taxes, which fill city coffers.\nSupervisors will also get an update on the county's Climate Action Plan and Wildfire Mitigation Plan. The background material isn't out yet about the specifics.\nThe thing the country has to wrap its head around is that voters don't give a rip about climate change anymore. If they did, they wouldn't have voted for a president who called it a Chinese hoax. The same voters who demanded change on climate, also decided the awfulness of Gaza in 2023-24 trumped 5,000 years of global catastrophe. Gotta love living in a meme world.\nI'm at the point where I'm starting to think mitigation needs to take precedent over prevention of climate change. The county might also want to consider the Marjorie Taylor Greene presidency of 2048 because climate refugees will only add fuel for the America First crowd. Breaking 3 degrees of warming will light a veritable Festivus of Hatred toward people fleeing the effects.\nHere's some good news for the county, as a program appears to be working designed to help Pima County Adult Detention Center inmates with substance abuse and mental health issues.\nThe Inmate Navigation, Enrollment, Stabilization and Treatment program was established in 2019 and has been evaluated along the way. The Board of Supervisors will get an update on the final evaluation.\nRecidivism among those involved in the program fell by 31 percent. That was a 55 percent improvement over the target of 20 percent. Saving achieved by \"jail avoidance\" (yes, it's a thing) was estimated at $486,588.\nParticipants in INVEST also were found to have achieved better employment and housing stability.\nSo, now the Sheriff's Department is asking for an expansion in the program. Re-read the part about the county budget outlook.\nMeanwhile, $8 million in opioid settlement funding will be used to provide substance prevention and response.\nSupervisors will also be choosing from their ranks a representative to sit on the board of the Regional Transportation Authority.\nChairman Rex Scott should have the gig. The supervisor has had the post before, knows the issues, the details, the players and he plays well with others.\nThey'll also be picking a Visit Tucson rep from the board. One of the new people would be good there. Heck, put Republican Steve Christy on the tourism board. It might not be a bad idea to put a car dealer on an organization that is supposed to sell Tucson like a Chrysler or a Jeep.\nSupervisor Matt Heinz is asking the board to start an economic development plan to create financial incentives to bring Mexican business and workers into the country to shore up critical labor shortages in services like health care.\nOn the one hand, Heinz didn't get the memo that immigrants need not apply in the U.S. for the foreseeable future. On the other hand, Heinz seems to be seizing on the Trump administration's hopes to relocate businesses to the U.S.\nHe's also asking for three cents for Affordable Housing but he's not clear where the three cents comes from. Primary property taxes I imagine, but he doesn't say on his agenda request.\nThe idea is to raise $207 million over 10 years to help the county get closer to it's goal of 38,000 homes over the next decade. To build 38,000 homes at $200,000 a pop would cost $7.6 billion.\nIn Oro Valley, the Town Council will vote Wednesday on approving a $12.6 million loan to complete the Northwest Recharge, Recovery and Delivery System (NWRRDS, the worst initialism ever).\nIn 2017 Metro Water, the town of Marana and the town of Oro Valley each approved a 50-year agreement to build and maintain the recharge pond. The cost was estimated at $26 million and then came the inevitable over-run. There was a need for $12 million more.\nSo the governments asked for a loan out of the state's Water Infrastructure Finance Authority.\nThe consortium went to WIFA for the NWRRDS for better H2\nWIFA is a perfectly fine acronym because it flows off the tongue. NWRRDS reads like an acronym having a seizure.\nThe debt is not to exceed $12,018,000 and just over $1 million of the principal is forgivable. The 20-year financing will be repaid out of water bills and the interest rates is capped at 4.25 percent.\nThe council will also consider a reworking of the town's master-planned downtown. It's actually either the Towne Center or the Town Centre. Town staff spells it both ways. Might we suggest \"Towne Centre\" for good measure?\nIt's 127 acres, divided into four areas at the intersection of North Oracle and West Pusch View roads.\nIt seems like there are concerns about height. There was a vote earlier in April on a church school requesting a height waiver. The idea is that there will be two different height limits. There's a 30-foot limit for buildings and then a 49-foot limit for architectural features.\nThe maximum size of a hotel is currently 75 feet and, apparently too high for the council now conscious of the perpendicular.\nCouncil members would initiate this plan amendment and not a developer. Prior to a vote, the changes would have to go to a pair of public meetings on the matter, a planning and zoning commission hearing and a public hearing in front of the council.\nThe Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors will vote to approve multiple judges and justices of the peace. All of them would be pro tempore.\nSheila Dragucon and Karla Berber would serve as temporary, part-time volunteer judges pro tempore. Boy, is that a lot of hedging. It's like they're like judges but they don't get business cards and their chambers are the snack bar.\nDee Dee Samel would be a part-time volunteer judge but not temporary.\nVanessa Cartwright would serve as a full-time judge pro tempore.\nAs far as Justices of the Peace go, Melinda Maddock, Deirdre Eshleman and Concepcion Bracamonte are all up for approval as temporary, part time, judges pro tempore.\nAll would serve from this July 1 to June 30, 2026.\nBlake Morlock is an award-winning columnist who worked in daily journalism for more than 25 years and is the former communications director for the Pima County Democratic Party.\nnews, politics & government, border, business, crime & safety, enviro, trans/growth, local, arizona, opinion, analysis, breaking, columnist,\nandres cano, budget, climate change, cynthia abril sosa ontiveros, jan lesher, karla morales, kimberly baeza, oro valley, pima county jail, raul grijalva, ray carroll, rex scott, richard elias, richard hernandez, steve christy, tucson agenda, water\nBe a watchdog with us!\nUnlike most news outlets, the Tucson Sentinel publishes our stories without a paywall.

    "content": "Trump orders U.S. military to occupy federal land along southern border\nPosted Apr 12, 2025, 12:09 pm\nPaul Ingram/TucsonSentinel.com\nDonald Trump in 2024 on the U.S.-Mexico border in Cochise County.\nPresident Donald Trump late Friday signed a memorandum directing several agencies to start militarizing a stretch of the southern border, an escalation of the administration’s use of the U.S. military amid its immigration crackdown.\nThe move, which The Washington Post first reported last month, could potentially put U.S. military members in direct contact with migrants, a possible violation of federal law.\nThe memo directs the Interior Department to allow the Defense Department to have jurisdiction over portions of federal land known as the Roosevelt Reservation, excluding any Native American reservations.\nBy creating a military buffer zone that stretches across the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona, California and New Mexico, it means any migrant crossing into the United States would be trespassing on a military base, therefore allowing active-duty troops to hold them until U.S. Border Patrol agents arrive.\nNational and military experts have raised concerns that giving control over the land to the military could violate the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law that generally prohibits the military from being used in domestic law enforcement.\nThe Friday memo instructs its “phased” implementation within 45 days, and says it could be expanded over time.\nThe memo is directed at the secretaries of the departments of Defense, Interior, Agriculture and Homeland Security.\n“The complexity of the current situation requires that our military take a more direct role in securing our southern border than in the recent past,” according to the memo.\nFriday’s announcement comes ahead of a report that is due to Trump by April 20 from the secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security with recommendations on whether or not to use the Insurrection Act of 1807 to aid in mass deportations.\nThe memo states: “At any time, the Secretary of Defense may extend activities under this memorandum to additional Federal lands along the southern border in coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Assistant to the President and Homeland Security Advisor, and other executive departments and agencies as appropriate.”\nThe memo also says that it’s part of an executive order Trump earlier this year signed, “Clarifying the Military’s Role in Protecting the Territorial Integrity of the United States.”\nThat executive order is one of five that lay out the use of military forces within the U.S. borders and extend other executive powers to speed up the president’s immigration crackdown.\nThis report was first published by the Arizona Mirror.\nbreaking, Az Mirror, rural, news, politics & government, border, war, local, arizona, nation/world, mexico/latin america,\ndefense dept, donald trump, immigration, interior dept, military, roosevelt reservation",

    "content": "Chinese woman commits suicide at Az Border Patrol station; BP failed to conduct welfare checks\nAgents didn't perform logged rounds; Surveillance video recorded first steps of suicide\nUpdated Apr 8, 2025, 9:03 pm ◇Originally posted Apr 3, 2025, 9:25 pm\nA 52-year-old woman committed suicide at the Border Patrol station in Yuma on Saturday, March 29, after she was taken into custody by agents in California, U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal said Wednesday.\nJayapal sharply criticized the agency and said \"initial reports\" show that Border Patrol agents failed to conduct welfare checks before the woman's death, and she said surveillance footage shows the woman creating a noose and hanging herself, but medical response was delayed for two hours.\nOfficials said the woman's death took place out of the view of cameras, but did not provide details about welfare checks in their initial statements to the Sentinel. Days later, they acknowledged that checks that had been logged as being completed \"were not performed.\"\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection officials did not follow internal policies about publicly acknowledging the death of someone in custody, providing a brief statement only after the Tucson Sentinel made direct inquiries about the matter Thursday.\nThe agency only released a required public notice of the woman's death on Tuesday, April 8 — nine days after the mandated deadline.\nJayapal, a Democratic congresswoman from Seattle, said the woman was taken into custody in California after officials said she overstayed her visa.\nThe unnamed woman, who the Sentinel determined had apparently been detained last Wednesday following a traffic stop near Needles, Calif., was transferred to Arizona where she was detained until her death over the weekend, Jayapal said.\n\"When Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents take a person into custody, they are responsible for their well-being, full stop,\" said Jayapal, the ranking member of the House's Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement Subcommittee. \"This detainee died by suicide, and initial reports have indicated that certain CBP procedures to ensure the safety and welfare of individuals in custody were not conducted,\" she said in a statement released by her congressional office.\n\"There is no excuse for why agents cannot verify if some of the necessary welfare checks occurred – or why some of the documented welfare checks were incorrectly reported.\"\n\"Surveillance footage showed the woman create a noose and tie it around her neck, yet no medical response occurred for nearly two hours,\" Jayapal said.\nJayapal added that according to \"information provided by CBP\" logs from the agency \"note that multiple welfare checks were conducted, however, CBP OPR was unable to verify if those checks actually occurred. She added that in some of the checks, a Border Patrol Processing Coordinator said he did not \"conduct the logged checks.\"\nA CBP spokesperson told the Sentinel on Friday that the woman was out of view of video cameras when she took her own life.\nBut on Tuesday, an \"incident summary\" released by the agency included an account of her death, indicating that her ripping up a mylar blanket, creating a noose, and placing it around her neck were all visible on detention cell surveillance video.\nThe woman was out of sight of the camera after doing so for more than one hour, the agency said.\nCBP's updated account said the woman had not been checked on for 7.5 hours overnight before her body was found. Six welfare checks that were recorded by Border Patrol personnel that night were \"not performed,\" officials said.\nThat account confirmed the Sentinel's original reporting that the woman arrested in Needles on March 26 was the same person who died in the Yuma detention center.\nBorder Patrol processing coordinators are not law enforcement personnel, but are trained to \"bring a humanitarian approach to the care of people in custody.\" Created in 2014 when the agency took thousands of children into custody, the position was expanded during the Biden administration, which hoped to create a corps of about 1,200 coordinators to help agents process people into custody and send Border Patrol agents back into the field.\nCustoms and Border Protection officials confirmed the woman's death in a statement to the Tucson Sentinel on Thursday night, but did not identify her.\nOn Saturday, March 29, a 52-year-old woman was \"unresponsive in a cell\" at the Yuma Border Patrol Station, a CBP spokesman said. \"Border Patrol personnel provided medical assistance,\" he wrote. \"Emergency Medical Services were called to the station and transported the woman to the local hospital, where she was pronounced deceased.\"\n\"Consistent with CBP protocol, the Office of Professional Responsibility is conducting an investigation of the incident,\" he said, adding the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General was also notified.\n\"Additional information will be made available in accordance with CBP’s policy,\" he said Thursday.\n\"Each holding cell is under constant video surveillance,\" the agency representative told the Sentinel on Friday. \"In this case, Border Patrol’s ability to observe the incident was limited due to privacy constraints — the incident occurred in a bathroom stall where cameras were not able to capture the full angle.\"\n\"All in-custody deaths are tragic, taken seriously, and are thoroughly investigated by CBP,\" the spokesperson said.\nIt remains unclear why the woman was in detention at the Yuma Sector's main station.\nThe Yuma Sector straddles the Colorado River and includes part of Southern California and well as Yuma County, Arizona. There are three stations in the sector, include the Bythe, Yuma and Wellton stations, and the sector covers about 126 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border.\nA day before the woman died, Yuma Sector Border Patrol announced they had arrested two people from China and seized more than $220,000 in cash during a vehicle stop on Wednesday, March 26, on Interstate 40 near Needles, Calif.\nAgents from the Yuma Sector's Blythe station stopped a minivan and among the four Chinese nationals in the car, two were illegally present in the U.S., officials said.\nThey also discovered the cash \"concealed in aluminum foil in two duffel bags.\" The agents arrested two people — a 38-year-old male and a 52-year-old female – and charged them as inadmissible under federal law. They added the cash \"was believed to be proceeds from illegal activity and was seized for laundering\" under federal laws providing for civil asset forfeiture.\nTuesday, CBP said the woman was in the United States on a B1/B2 business/tourist visa, which would have been valid for up to six months at a time. She entered the country in Los Angeles in February 2024, they said.\n'Incredibly concerned'\nJayapal said the woman was held after agents \"determined that she had overstayed a B1/B2 visitor visa,\" which is a short-term visa for business or tourism.\nJayapal also criticized the actions of BP agents at the station and said OPR investigators must \"provide answers on why welfare checks were not conducted and falsely recorded, and why this woman was able to die by suicide without any guard intervention.\"\nShe noted last year, two people died at the Northwest Immigrant Processing Center, a facility managed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\"I remain incredibly concerned about the conditions at these facilities,\" she said. CBP and ICE are both under the umbrella of the the Department of Homeland Security, currently led by Secretary Kristi Noem.\n\"Another preventable death only increases that concern,\" Jayapal said. \"Reports have consistently shown that the United States falls far short of its obligations to treat all detained people with dignity and fairness.\"\nConditions in Border Patrol stations have faced widespread criticism for more than a decade. In one case focused on the neighboring Tucson Sector—which runs from Yuma County to the New Mexico border—a federal judge wrote in 2020 ruling that conditions are \"presumptively punitive and violate the Constitution.\"\nCBP missed self-set deadline for announcing in-custody death\nThe announcement from Jayapal came days after a self-imposed deadline CBP set to publicly acknowledge in-custody deaths.\nIn 2018, following the death of a 7-year-old girl in New Mexico, CBP issued new guidelines. As part of the new policy, CBP said immediately following the death of a person in custody, officials would tell lawmakers about the incident with 24 hours, and issue statements to the press an hour after that.\nThat process is supposed to alert more than a half-dozen offices within CBP, including the commissioner of CBP and the Office of Professional Responsibility. The alert would also include the Inspector General's office, and the relevant consulate office through the State Department.\nAs one of the top lawmakers on the relevant House committee, Jayapal would be one of those informed. But CBP has not yet made any public statement about the death, responding only to the Sentinel's inquiries.\nUntil December 2018, CBP did not have a formal policy to announce in-custody deaths, however that changed following revelations by the Washington Post that a seven-year-old girl had died while in Border Patrol custody.\nThat year, Jakelin Amei Rosmery Caal Maquin and her father, Nery Gilberto Caal, 29, turned themselves into Border Patrol after they crossed into the United States with 161 other people near Forward Operating Base Bounds, in the boot heel of New Mexico near the Antelope Wells Port of Entry—a remote and lonely stretch of terrain south of Interstate 10.\n\"To secure and maintain the public trust, CBP’s intent is to be accessible and transparent by providing appropriate information to the Congress and the public regarding any death occurring in custody,\" the agency said.\nBorder crossings down\nSince October, Yuma Sector agents have taken 6,605 people into custody, a 76 percent decrease since the same period a year earlier. CBP officials have celebrated the drop and said in March, BP agents took 7,180 people into custody nationwide, and daily southwest border apprehensions fell to around 230 per day, part of a precipitous decline that began last June.\nbreaking, news, politics & government, border, crime & safety, local, arizona, nation/world,\nblythe, border patrol, california, cbp, china, congress, house, immigration, pramila jayapal, yuma, yuma sector\nBe a watchdog with us!\nUnlike most news outlets, the Tucson Sentinel publishes our stories without a paywall.

    "content": "Tucson Councilman Richard Fimbres resigning in May; in 16th year in office\nSeat to be filled by appointment; South Side Democrat previously announced he was not seeking reelection this year\nPosted Apr 11, 2025, 1:55 pm\nDylan Smith & Jim Nintzel\nTucson City Councilman Richard Fimbres will step down on May 1, leaving his Ward 5 seat open amid an ongoing election. He announced in January that he was not seeking reelection this year, after holding office since 2009.\nThe South Side Democrat said Friday that serving on the Council \"has been an honor and a privilege\" but \"my personal health issues now compel me to step aside from my duties as a public servant.\nFimbres, 72, has not been attending City Council meetings in person since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, generally taking part virtually via video or phone. He has not publicly detailed his health issues, leading to speculation about a stroke or long COVID. He has made only limited public appearances since 2020, and was last elected in 2021.\n\"I had hoped to complete my current term of office, but I need to turn my full attention to my family and my health,\" he said in a letter to Mayor Regina Romero and the rest of the Council. \"I'm providing you this notice now so that you and my peers on the Council can begin the steps you choose to take to fill the vacancy that will occur on the effective date of my resignation.\"\nIn a news release, the mayor said, \"It has been my honor to work with Richard Fimbres on issues that matter to Tucsonans.\"\n\"He founded the Homeless Work Program, an innovative public/private partnership that has helped hundreds of our unsheltered neighbors. He worked to create the Buffalo Soldier’s Memorial to recognize the contributions of African American Soldiers in Southern Arizona. Richard focused on veterans' issues and always worked to protect workers and the most vulnerable in our community. Our collaboration with neighbors on the Santa Rita Park Master Plan is an excellent example of his positive impact to reinvest in Ward 5 neighborhoods,\" Romero said.\nThe mayor said she appreciated his political support.\n\"I used to call him my tio; Tio Richard,\" Romero said.\nFimbres, a native Tucsonan and Vietnam-era Army veteran, graduated from Tucson High in 1973. He studied at Pima Community College, the University of Arizona and Northern Arizona University.\nHe served 32 years with the Pima County Sheriff’s Department, and worked as director of the Governor's Office of Highway Safety. Fimbres served seven years on the Pima Community College Board, a post he gave up after winning his City Council seat. He was inducted into the Arizona Veterans Hall of Fame in 2021.\n\"Richard’s public service record is distinguished. He and my father both served in the 8th of the 40th Armored Battalion reserve unit here in Tucson,\" Councilmember Paul Cunningham told the Sentinel. \"His work on the Governors Office of Highway Safety and with the Pima Community College board demonstrates a commitment to making Tucson better. His work on the City Council for the homeless work program, the P-card and advocacy of the Cherrybell post office are stalwart examples of what public service is all about. I am honored to have served with him and proud to call him a friend.\"\nCouncilmember Nikki Lee told the Sentinel, \"I always advocate for prioritizing health and family, and I’m glad Richard is able to take this well-deserved retirement time and focus on both of those things. His entire adult life has been dedicated to serving our country, state, county, and city. He is the truest of public servants and it's been an honor to serve alongside him on the Council.\"\nCity Councilmember Karin Uhlich said that Fimbres is \"truly a kind and caring man, and I feel privileged to have worked alongside him.\"\n\"As a veteran and state and local official for decades, he has always been deeply devoted to serving with integrity and compassion,\" said the longtime member of the Council.\nCouncilmember Kevin Dahl said he was grateful for the opportunity to serve alongside Fimbres, calling him \"a powerful and effective representative for his ward, even recently when his health concerns kept him from meeting with us in person.\"\nHe recalled that Fimbres attended Dahl's first ribbon-cutting after he was elected to the Ward 3 seat \"and made sure I knew how to celebrate such an event with style.\"\n\"When I was a freshman councilmember, he would often reach out to make sure I had the best information to understand the issues before us,\" Dahl said. \"Later, he would always consult with me on issues in my Ward. Richard's team would regularly provide insightful questions on matters before the council, making sure city staff would provide the helpful answers to all of us.\"\nCouncilmember Lane Santa Cruz said Fimbres' \"commitment to improving the quality of life for families on Tucson's South Side has helped shape a more connected, supportive and resilient community.\"\n\"From championing infrastructure improvements to uplifting youth and veterans, his legacy is one of heart, hard work and deep love for his district,\" Santa Cruz said.\n“Richard Fimbres’ work on the City Council leaves a lasting legacy in Tucson,” said City Manager Timothy Thomure. “He worked tirelessly to facilitate, as he accurately called it many times at the council table, a 'Ward 5 Renaissance,' The Bridges is a prime example of this ‘renaissance’ as it brought much needed economic opportunity and service amenities to Tucson’s South Side residents.”\nOther examples of successful economic development projects that Council Member Fimbres worked to make happen in our community and in Ward 5 include the expansion of Raytheon, the opening of the HomeGoods Distribution Center, GEICO’s Regional Headquarters, and Chamberlain Garage Doors.\nThe City Charter provides for the filling of a vacancy on the Council, including a vacancy caused by the resignation of a councilmember. Under Chapter VIII, Sec. 2 of the Charter, the mayor and Council will select a qualified elector of Ward 5 to fill the vacancy caused by Councilmember Fimbres’ resignation. That selection will take place at a regular or special session of the mayor and Council. The person selected by the mayor and Council will serve as the Ward 5 councilmember for the remainder of the existing term. The Ward 5 Council seat is up for election this November.\nWhile the seat will be filled on an interim basis by an appointee, this year's election will determine who will serve the four years after that.\nFour Democrats filed to run in the South Side ward:\nSelina Barajas, who previously worked at the Sunnyside Foundation\nLongtime local businessman Jesse Lugo\nRookie candidate Christopher Elsner, a Peace Corps veteran\nHip-hop artist Fabian Danobeytia\nNo Republican candidate filed to seek the office in the election.\nBarajas told the Sentinel that Fimbres \"served Ward 5 honorably for nearly 16 years, and I would like to thank him for his dedicated service to this community and for his years of service in our nation’s armed forces. His commitment to the people of Tucson, alongside the dedicated members of his longtime staff, have left a lasting impact on the Ward 5 community. As he steps down to focus on his health, I join many in expressing deep gratitude for his leadership and wishing him strength and healing.\"\nLugo, who is endorsed by the longtime councilmember to replace him, said Fimbres has \"offered very distinguished service for many, many years. I hope that his health improves.\"\nNone of the candidates ruled out applying to complete the remainder of Fimbres' term through December, though none of them said they planned to apply.\nBarajas said she was \"fully focused on earning the trust of Ward 5 voters as I run for the full term. Right now, that's where all of my attention is.\"\nLugo said he hadn't decided whether he'd apply but he thought he could be a contender since he had Fimbres' endorsement in the primary race.\n\"Richard Fimbres endorsed me so it's up to the mayor and the other Council members whether to accept me or not,\" Lugo said.\nElsner said he needed to know more about the process.\n\"I'd want to know more about the process and ramifications before making a decision,\" he said.\nDanobeytia said he was still \"looking into how this changes the landscape and determining the next steps to take.\"\nRomero said she wanted to swiftly move forward with appointing a new Council member.\n\"We need to fill this vacancy as quickly as we can,\" the mayor said. \"We're in the middle of a budget.\"\nRomero said the Council would discuss the appointment process at the April 22 meeting and she hoped to make a decision by the May 6 meeting.\nRomero, who has endorsed Barajas in the election, said she did not want to appoint any of the Ward 5 Democrats now running in the Aug. 5 primary election.\n\"I don't think we should put our thumb on the scale,\" she said.\nLee and Cunningham agreed with the mayor.\nLee said she \"100 percent\" wanted to appoint a \"caretaker of the seat\" rather than a current candidate.\n\"With the primary underway, I do not want to give any incumbency benefit to anyone and want the Ward 5 residents to make their choice at the ballot box,\" Lee said.\nCunningham said he thought appointing a candidate \"would not be appropriate.\"\n\"We need to leave it to the Ward 5 voters in November,\" Cunningham said.\nUhlich said she would \"prefer someone not running\" but wanted to hear from her colleagues and the community.\nDahl said he hadn't yet made any decisions about the appointment process.\nSanta Cruz said that \"with the election so close, I prefer a caretaker\" for the Ward 5 seat.\nnews, politics & government, local, arizona, breaking,\ncity council, election, jesse lugo, karin uhlich, lane santa cruz, nikki lee, paul cunningham, regina romero, richard fimbres, selina barajas, tim thomure\nBe a watchdog with us!\nUnlike most news outlets, the Tucson Sentinel publishes our stories without a paywall.
